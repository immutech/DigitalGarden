[[Wang Xianzhi 王献之]]有一个外甥叫[[Yang Xin 羊欣]]。羊欣小的时候常到舅父家去玩，看王献之写字。王献之非常喜欢他，经常教他读书写字。

Wang Xianzhi had a nephew called Yang Xin. When he was young he'd often visit his uncle, watching as Wang Xianzhi wrote calligraphy. Wang Xianzhi was very fond of him and often taught him how to read and write characters. 

有一年夏天，王献之到羊欣的家里来了。这一天他到书房去看羊欣。一进门，见小羊欣正趴在桌上睡觉，“呼噜，呼噜”，睡的正香呢！王献之没有把小羊欣叫醒，顺手提笔在他的绢裙上写了几行字，就走出了书房。

One summer's day, Wang Xianzhi paid a visit to Yang Xin's family. He walked into the study to see his nephew, but when he entered the room, he saw that Yang Xin was far away in the land of nod, snoring as he rested his head on the desk in front of him. Wang Xianzhi didn't wake him. Instead, he picked up a brush and wrote a few lines of characters on the silk laid out in front of Yang Xin. Then, he left.

羊欣醒来，发现舅舅写的几行字高兴极了。因为舅舅是不轻易给别人提字的。得到他的字是很不容易的。但是他更是感到惭愧，后悔刚才贪睡，让舅舅白来一趟也没看到舅舅写字。晚饭以后羊欣去找舅舅。这时候，舅舅正在和父亲谈话。羊欣进去给他们请安。父亲沉着脸对羊欣说：“你睡够了吗？”

When Yang Xin awoke, he was thrilled to see the line of freshly written characters, because his uncle seldom wrote inscriptions for people. Owning some of his characters was a real privilege. But he soon felt a pang of guilt too: he regretted having taken a nap, his uncle had visited in vain and he hadn't been able to watch his uncle write. After supper, Yang Xin went to look for his uncle, who was deep in conversation with his father. Yang Xin wished them both a good evening. His father's expression was sombre when he asked him: "Are you well rested?"

羊欣低着头站着，过了好一会儿才低声的说：“我以后不贪睡了。”

Yang Xin bowed his head in shame. It was quite a while before he replied with a whisper: "I won't take naps anymore."

父亲说：“你想写好字，又不刻苦怎么行？你舅舅和我商量好了，明天你就到他家去，跟他学书法。”

His father went on: "How will you ever excel at the art of writing if you don't hone your skills? I've discussed it with your uncle: starting tomorrow, you going to live with him and learn calligraphy."

羊欣高兴地答应了。从此，羊欣跟随王献之读书写字。他每天早起晚睡，学习非常勤奋。他还把舅舅写的那几行字挂在自己的书房里，常常临摹。

Over the moon, Yang Xin agreed to the proposal. From that day on, Yang Xin studied the art of writing with Wang Xianzhi. Each day he'd work hard, rising at the crack of dawn and studying late into the night. He hung the characters his uncle had written on the wall of his study, and would often copy them. 

十多年过去了。羊欣也成了有名的书法家。当时有句谚语：“买王得羊，不失所望”。意思是说：买王献之的字，没有买到；得到了羊欣的字，也是一件幸事。

Ten years past. Yang Xin also became a calligrapher of some repute. At the time there was a saying: '*mǎi wáng dé yáng, bù shī sǔo wàng*' which means: 'if you can't buy calligraphy by Wang Xianzhi, but instead, you buy some by Yang Xin, that's still something worth celebrating.'
