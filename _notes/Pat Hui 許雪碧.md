### Introduction

Born in 1943 in Hong Kong, Pat Hui is an ink painter known for her colourful paintings. Wucius Wong, who she often collaborates with, wrote “her colours are sometimes in quiet pastel shades, but generally tend to exhibit a strong radiant quality, evoking a sense of pathos often expressed in Song poems with themes of solitude, remorsefulness, and desolation, employing images of distinctive colour sensations such as falling petals, willows, autumn leaves, the setting sun, the moon.”（Wucius Wong, _Pat Hui,_ Alisan Fine Arts, Hong Kong, 1993, .P.6）  
  

Hui began studying painting under Lui Shou-Kwan in 1961 after Wong introduced them. Following undergraduate studies in Philosophy at the University of Hong Kong, she attended the University of Minnesota where she completed a PhD in Western Philosophy with a minor in Chinese and Indian Buddhism. In 1974, she studied Studio Art and Design at the same university. In 1978, she moved to Canada and began designing clothes using her own technique of painting on silk. Since then she has founded her own fine art gallery Hui Arts in Canada and the United States, and the art studio Traffic Zone Centre for Visual Arts in Minneapolis. All the while she has continued painting, combining her ink art with her studies in philosophy and literature.
