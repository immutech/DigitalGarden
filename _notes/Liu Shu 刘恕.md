The retired official, connoisseur and bibliophile owned [[留园 The Lingering Garden]]1797-1816. Using the last two characters from a couplet:

**竹色清寒，波光澄碧** 
"the *cold* hue of bamboo, the pure *jade* sheen of waves"  

he named what was originally the Eastern Garden, to [[Cold Jade Manor 寒碧庄]]. This is partly in hommage to his family home on the East Mountian of Dongting Lake. 

He was a "fool for rocks" or a 石痴者. In English this particular affliction has been called [[lithophilia]], or [[petromania]]. Similar to another famous lithophile, [[Mi Fu 米芾]], he collected:

1. [[Lake Tai Rock太湖石]]；and
2. [[Stone Calligraphy Slab 书条石]].

In 1802, Liu purchased the so-called [[12 Peaks of Hanbi Estate 寒碧庄十二峰]]. Portraits of each stone with calligraphic descriptions were rendered by one of Liu's house guests, [[Wang Xuehao 王学浩]].
