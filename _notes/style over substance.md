#维科 [[维科对汉字的想法]] [[外国人关于六种书体的想法]] The argument that written language is only the [[the apparatus of knowledge]] and that ideographic languages like chinese are inferior to phonetic languages, because they are more difficult to learn, therefore, the users of such a language become bogged down in learning how to communicate rather than pursueing "true knowledge". 

Reformist and author, [[Lu Xun]] famously stated：

	“汉字不灭中国必亡” If Chinese characters are not eliminated, the Chinese nation will perish.
