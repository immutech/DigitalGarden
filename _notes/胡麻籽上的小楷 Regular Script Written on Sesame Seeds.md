清代有一个善于写小楷字的书法家，名字叫[[Weng Fanggang 翁方纲]]。他是现在北京大兴县人。

During the Qing Dynasty, there was a calligrapher famous for his regular script calligraphy, called Weng Fanggang. He came from Daxing County, next to Beijing. 

翁方纲的眼力非常好。他能在胡麻籽（就是芝麻籽）上写字：开始在一粒胡麻籽上只写一个字，后来就能写四个字了。

Weng Fanggang was blessed with perfect vision. He perfected the art of writing on sesame seeds. In the beginning, he'd write just one character, but soon he was able to write up to four characters on one seed. 

有一天一位朋友来找翁方纲，想亲眼看看他是怎样在胡麻籽上写小楷的。翁方纲拿起笔就在一粒胡麻籽上写起来。

One day a friend came to visit Weng Fanggang. The act of writing microscopic regular script on a sesame seed had to be seen to be believed. Weng Fanggang picked up a brush and began writing.

朋友看完了，从衣袋里掏出一个小纸包，拿出几粒胡麻籽，请翁方纲挥笔写字留作纪念。翁方纲看这几粒胡麻籽比以前的稍大些，可以多写几个字。他就高兴的对朋友说：“贤兄要写什么呢？你带来的这几粒籽，每个上面都可以写七个字。”

After watching, the friend removed a small paper cachet from his pocket and poured out a few sesame seeds, asking if Weng Fanggang would sign them as a souvenir. Weng remarked that the sesame seeds were larger than most, and he could probably write a few more characters than usual on each one. Smiling, he asked his friend: "What would you like me to write? I can fit up to 7 characters on each one of these sesame seeds you brought."

朋友想了想，说: “就写一句唐诗吧！”

His friend thought for a while and replied: "How about a line of Tang Dynasty poetry!"

翁方纲立刻提笔在胡麻籽上写了：“一片冰心在玉壶”，端端正正的七个字。朋友一边赞叹着：“好极了”，一边小心的包起胡麻籽，像宝物一样珍藏起来。

Weng picked up the brush and wrote 7 characters, formal and proper: *yí piàn bīng xīn zài yù hú* (literally: "a heart of ice in a jade teapot", this is a metaphor for integrity which come from a poem by Wang Changling). "amazing!" the friend exclaimed as he carefully picked up the sesame seed, treasuring it like a priceless diamond.
