明朝时候，山阴【现在浙江绍兴】有个自称为“天池山人”和“青藤道士”的书画家。他的真实名字是[[Xu Wei 徐渭]]，又叫徐文长。

During the Ming Dynasty, in a place called Shan Yin (present-day Shaoxing in Zhejiang Province), there was a painter and calligrapher who called himself the "Hermit of the Tianchi" and "Blue Vine Daoist". His real name was Xu Wei, and his friends called him Xu Wenchang. 

徐文长写得一笔漂亮的狂草字，在当地很有名气。有好多有钱人都想得到他的手迹。可徐文长偏不喜欢跟这些有钱人来往。

Xu Wenchang was a master of wild cursive script and was something of a local celebrity. People were willing to pay a pretty penny to own something written by his hand. But Xu Wenchang didn't enjoy the company of the rich. 

有一次山阴城里有个财主，新建了一间书斋【zhāi】，托家里的教书先生去请徐文长为他的书斋题一块匾额，并表示愿出重金酬谢。

One day, a local tycoon in downtown Shan Yin decided to build a new study. He sent the household tutor to ask Xu Wenchang to write a name plaque for his study, saying that he'd pay handsomely for the work. 

徐文长知道以后心想：“这个财主平时为人势利刻薄，一毛不拔，今天为什么这样大方，花重金来买我的字呢？我看他不过是想拿我的字去装装门面，抬高自己的身价。我何不顺水推舟，来一个‘将计就计’呢？”

Xu Wenchang thought to himself: "That tycoon is usually so snobbish and stingy. why is he suddenly so generous, willing to pay top dollar for my calligraphy? I think he wants to brag about my work to entertain the facade that he's cultured, to elevate his social standing. I'll play along, and give him a surprise...with a sting in the tail."

于是徐文长不露声色，满口答应随手写了“竹苞”两个字，交给了教书先生。

And so Xu Wenchang agreed, giving no hint as to his true intention. He picked up the brush, wrote two characters *zhu bao*, and presented them to the tycoons household tutor. 

那个财主看了徐文长的手迹，乐得合不拢嘴，马上请工匠制成匾额，挂在书斋门口。他还邀请亲友来欣赏。

The tycoon grinned from ear to ear when he received the characters written by Xu Wenchang. Immediately he sent for artisans to make them into a plaque and hang it above the door to his new study. He even invited guests and family to celebrate the event.

第二天，客人不断的来观赏匾额。

The next day, guests arrived to witness the unveiling of the new plaque.

有人说：”这两个字，不光字写得好，而且含义更好：‘竹苞’来源于‘竹苞松茂’【是比喻根深叶茂的意思】，用这两个字来做斋名太好了！”还有人对财主说：“徐文长的狂草可是难得的珍品呐！”

One guest remarked: "These two characters aren't just written well, the meaning is even better: the characters *zhu bao* are an allusion to the saying *zhū bāo sōng mào*, which means 'the roots run deep and the foliage is lush'. What a great name for a study!" turning to the tycoon they gushed: "Xu Wenchang's wild cursive calligraphy is a rare treasure indeed!"

财主听了，马上装出一副行家的样子，摇头晃脑地连声说：“徐君与我是多年的老朋友了。前几天，他路过我家，对新建的书斋很欣赏，随即写了这两个字相赠······”

The tycoon assumed the air of a seasoned connoisseur, nodding profusely: "Old Xu and I go way back, a couple of days ago he was passing by and he couldn't get enough of this new study of mine. He wrote these characters as a gift."

这事很快就传开了。人们都很奇怪，徐文长一向为人耿直倔强，这回怎么跟这些庸俗的财主们来往呢？后来有一个好奇的读书人，特地跑去仔细地观察这匾额。

The news spread fast. People were perplexed: Xu Wenchang was a man of strong principles. How on earth would he be friends with a man as vulgar as the tycoon? One curious scholar heard the news and made a trip to see the plaque for himself. 

他左看右看，反复琢磨，才看清了“竹苞”两个字的笔势字态，终于明白了徐文长的用意。原来徐文长故意把这两个字写的非草非篆，歪歪斜斜，拆开来明明是“个个草包”四个字。

He stared long and hard, mulling the characters over in his mind, he looked at the shape of each stroke and suddenly, he realised Xu Wenchangs true intent: he had written the characters in a script that was neither seal script nor cursive script but something in between. Looking closer at the crooked strokes provided a different interpretation with not two, but four characters: *gè gè cǎo bāo*, 'idiots one and all'.

不久，这块匾额的真实含义让财主知道了。他又气又悔，哭笑不得，只好赶快叫人把它取了下来。

It wasn't long until the tycoon caught wind of the true meaning of the plaque. Angry, embarrassed and ashamed, he didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Immediately, he sent someone to take down the offensive plaque.
