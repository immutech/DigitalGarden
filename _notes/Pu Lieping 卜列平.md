**Pu Lieping 卜列平** 

### Biography

born in Chengdu,1959. In 1967, at the age of eight, he had the distressing experience of seeing his father harassed by the Red Guards and forced to wear a dunce's cap. In 1980 he began taking private calligraphy lessons from Bai Yunshu, a leading local calligrapher and scholar. The following year, at the age of just twenty-two, Pu Lieping was rated among the ten best calligraphers in the province in an open competition. As his role models he chose two past calligraphers whose example he felt would help him find his own style: Mi Fu (1051-1107) and Huaisu (725-785). Gu Gan's book "The Formation of Modern Calligraphy" (1986) had a notable influence on him. He wanted to find a way to employ calligraphic forms to express both a sense of China's great heritage and its cultural essence in a contemporary context, although the more he experimented within the frame of Modernism, the more he came to realize that using readable characters was constraining his own creativity. Throughout the decade, Pu Lieping experimented with what he defined as the creation of "Visual Music". He was still using readable characters, but their shape and structure were now more distorted than a few years earlier, capturing a sense of movement and harmony he assimilated with that of music.

In 2000 he developped a new technique, using calligraphic brushstrokes to give shape to his compositions. See, for example, 2001.0203.2
