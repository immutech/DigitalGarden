狂僧不为酒  
狂笔自通天  
将书云霞片  
直至清明巅

  
Monks are not made mad on wine but on  
The mad brush that penetrates Heaven.  
Its words are written on dawn's red clouds,  
Rising to the purest, brightest peaks.

  
手中飞黑电  
象外泻玄泉  
万物随指顾  
三光为回旋

  
From this hand, black lightning flies.  
From beyond appearances flows a mysterious spring.  
All sentient beings follow in an instant and  
The lights of Heaven return to their beginnings.

  
聚书云霮�  
洗砚山晴鲜  
忽怒画蛇虺  
喷然生风烟

  
It gathers its poetry onto towering clouds,  
Washes its inkstone in mountains' bright freshness.  
The sudden passion of these deadly ink snakes  
Spreads out like smoke upon the wind.

  
江人愿停笔  
惊浪恐倾船

  
The river-boatmen want to stop this brush,  
Fearing its violent waves would swamp their boat.
