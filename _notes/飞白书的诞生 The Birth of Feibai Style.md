东汉的时候，有个很有名的文学家和书法家，名字叫蔡邕「yōng」。他曾经把六部有名的书（称为“六经”）写在石碑上，由工匠刻出来，立在太学门外。石碑刚立起来，就有很多人前来观看，有赞叹的，与学着写的。每天来往的车辆多得把道路都给堵住了。

Back in the days of the Eastern Han dynasty, there was a famous writer and calligrapher by the name of [[蔡邕 Cai Yong]]. He once copied six famous works of literature (called the "[[lìu jīng 六经]]") onto stone tablets, and craftsmen carved out the characters. The tablets were erected outside the gates of the [[太学 Imperial Academy]]. As soon as the tablets had been erected, lots of people came to see them, some were awestruck, and others studied how the characters were written. There were so many carts every day that the roads were completely blocked. 

有一次，蔡邕到皇宫里拜见皇帝，出来的时候，路过一个地方，看见有几个工匠正在用扫帚蘸「zhàn」着白恢在墙上写字。写出来的字雄健有力，龙飞凤舞，笔画中还有不少空白，非常好看。蔡邕站在那里，不由得看出了神。他仔细观察工匠们运“笔”的方法，看他们手和腕部的动作，看了很久才回家去，连已经约好到一个朋友家去吃饭的事都忘了。

One day on his way out after calling on the emperor in the palace, Cai Yong saw some artisans dipping brooms into white ash and writing on the walls. The characters they wrote were full of vigour: like the flight of dragons and dances of the phoenix. The streakiness of the brushstrokes was incredibly eye-catching. Cai Yong stood there, mesmerised: He observed the way the artisans moved their "brushes", watching how they moved their hands and their wrists. He watched for a long time before going home. He even forgot about a friend's invitation to dinner.

回到家里， 蔡邕还在琢磨这件事。从这天起，他每天在家里模仿刷墙的工匠，用扫帚在墙上又写又画，摸索写这种字的规律。结果，本来干干净净的墙壁，让他弄的乱七八糟。

After returning home, Cai Yong continued mulling over what he had seen. From that day on, every day he would use a broom, mimicking the movements of the artisans he had seen painting on the walls, writing and drawing pictures: trying to find the knack of writing characters in the style he had seen. As a result, he made a complete mess of a wall that had been perfectly clean and tidy.

他的夫人见了，生气的对他说：“你中了什么邪？不在纸上写，偏要在墙上乱写，跟个小孩子似的。”

When his wife saw, she was very angry and scolded: "What's gotten into you? You should be writing on paper! Instead, you're scribbling on the walls like a toddler."

蔡邕笑着说：“你不知道，我正在琢磨一种新的字体呢！”

"You don't get it, do you? I'm in the process of inventing a new style of character." Cai Yong chuckled. 

经过长时间的摸索，蔡邕创造的一种新字体终于诞生了。这种字体在笔画中露出一丝丝白，人们就叫它“飞白书”。它的形状又像布帛迎风飞舞，所以，有人把这种字体叫坐“飞帛”。

After a long period of experimenting, Cai Yong's new style of character was finally born. The strokes of characters in this style had white streaks, so people named it '[[flying white 飞白书]]'. The shapes also look like cloth fluttering in the wind, so some call this style of character '[[Fluttering Cloth 飞帛]]'
