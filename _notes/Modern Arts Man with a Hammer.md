# Modern Chinese Calligraphy: The Road Ahead.

Simon Leys once wrote an article entitled "One more art." 

The modern art world needs to take a hint and recognize that calligraphy is not abstract expressionism. Just as in the pre-Han times before Clerical Transformation, anonymous scribes and the characters they wrote played a role in the [[ritual art tradition]], subordinate to sacrificial vessels or monuments, the works of [[Xu Bing 徐冰]] and [[Gu Wenda 谷文达]] subordinate calligraphy, making it an element of what I call the [[installation tradition]]. If we substituted a few characters from[[Tian Shu 天书]] it wouldn't make a huge amount of difference to the viewer, who is concerned with the fact that the pages drape from the ceilings, plaster the walls and cover the ground. The main requirement of the characters is that they instil in the viewer a sense of illegibility, both familiar and strange at the same time. This is an art which is highly conceptual, but not calligraphic. 

 What then should we make of theorists like Zhang Qiang and his invention 'traceology' a subject accompanied by tomes of literature? I would say that Michael Sullivan has something to say here. In his book about 20th-century Chinese art, Sullivan remarked: 

"the spontaneous outpourings of the truly gifted artists...{are} full of life, wit, and invention. For hundreds of lesser talents, it is an easy shortcut, in which shallow thought can be hailed as spontaneity, untrained brushwork and incompetent calligraphy passed off as eccentricity.

French author François-René de Chateaubriand once wrote: An ambition without matching talent is a crime. Here I find Zhang Qiang guilty. As performance art, perhaps, traceology is an interesting concept, but it hardly satisfies the criteria necessary to appreciate good calligraphy. In a lecture given at the Huntington Chinese Garden last year, when asked about how to appreciate wild cursive calligraphy, prof. Peter Sturman said:

"You try to follow the brush, try to imagine the energy that went into it, you look at the composition, you look at the balance, you look at the change in the tonalities, you try to get into reliving the experience of the writing: If you're really attuned to it, you can sometimes see how there are limitations to the calligrapher...It's an incredibly difficult art form. Just to master the brush, then to learn the cursive forms, and then to be natural about it, to somehow capture that balance of discipline and naturalness."

There is no real discipline in traceology. Because of the way the performance space and tools are designed, it's impossible to demonstrate a cohesive vision. It's a calligraphic version of the Rorschach inkblot. Without a framework, how do we judge creativity? Without a time signature, how do we judge rhythm? Breathtaking calligraphy demonstrates creativity within constraint. 

Here we can turn to Su Shi and his assessment of Zhang Xu and Huai Su, who are famous for wild cursive styles, like the [[Four Ancient Poems 古诗四首]] owned by the Liaoning Provincial Museum and the [[Autobiographical Essay 自叙帖]] owned by the Palace Museum in Taipei. His assessment of the work wasn't particularly kind:

"Crazy Zhang and Drunken Su, those two (garrulous) fellows, chased shamelessly after the public fancy and called their calligraphy skilful. Even in their dreams, they could not have laid eyes upon Wang Xizhi and Zhong You. Foolishly adorning themselves with powder and jewels to cheat the deaf and blind, like a street trollop smearing herself with red and blue make-up, performing a bewitching song and seductive dance to dazzle the eyes of the youngsters."

I think this rather snobbish review stems from a mentality adopted by traditional Chinese artists, which again is summed up very well by Michael Sullivan, who says:

	"The Western artist has never been ashamed to be called a professional. In China, by contrast, although there was a class of professional artists, no educated man or woman would have liked to be thought of as earning his or her living by the brush. When the educated artist...wrote inscriptions or memorial essays, great care was taken to see that payment was made indirectly, so that his status as an amateur was not compromised." 
	
A mentality which was reinforced by the popular concept of 戏子 being part of the lowest rung of society. But, in a 21st-century capitalist society, where KOL are a driving force in the economy, can we use that same mentality to judge works of modern Chinese calligraphy? On a bipolar scale where the extremes are either reclusive monk or dancing monkey, there must be some middle ground for the 21st-century Chinese calligrapher.
