### [[Nathan Dunn]]的1834年的《万唐人物》展目录
万唐人物目录第75页记载了挂在会展上的众多[[楹联]]。文字对所使用的书体没有过多的描述，主要是介绍楹联各种成语的内容。原文如下：

Maxims on the Entablatures.

The visiter will observe that over the capital of each pillar is a piece of carving of circular form, gilt and painted vermillion and green alternatively. There are ten of these on each side of the saloon. Each has a Chinese character carved in the center. The characters on the right to a person entering, form the following maxim: -- Kwa tien po na ly : ly hia po ching kwan. The interpretation of which is, In a field of melons, do not pull up your shoe : under a plum tree do not adjust your cap : i.e. be very careful of your actions under circumstances of suspicion. 	

The characters on the opposite side of the room, commencing from the lower end, form the following maxim: -- Loo yaou chy ma lie : je kew kien jin sin. The interpretation of which is, By a long journey we know a horse's strength ; so length of days shows a mans heart. 

Between these circular carvings are maxims placed horizontally, and extending around the whole entablature. As is customary in China, the maxims are placed opposite to each other, are embellished exactly alike, though the maxims themselves are both the same. It is unneccesary to give the interpretation of all of these, as there are so many. a few are subjoined as a specimen. "As a scream of the eagle is heard when she has passed over : so a man's name remains after his death." -- "Though a tree be a thousand chang* in height, its leaves must fall down and return to its root." -- "Following virtue is like ascending a steep : following vice is like running down a precipice." -- "Man perishes in the pursuit of wealth, as a bird meets with destruction in search of its food." -- "The cure of ignorance is study, as meat is that of hunger." -- "Unsullied poverty is always happy ; while impure wealth brings with it many sorrows." -- "Petty distinctions are injurious to rectitude ; quibbling words violate right reason." -- "Those who respect themselves will be honourable ; but he who thinks lightly of himself will be held cheap by the world." -- "Virtue is the surest road to longevity ; but vice meets with an early doom."

布景的楹联装饰性强，贴金箔又涂了红、绿两种漆。也许这样比较符合晚清的帝王审美。至于用的是哪一种书体，目录只字不提。反而对楹联的内容记录颇为详细：从这些楹联能看出，表现的内容以儒教思想为主，三从四德正好也符合当时基督教徒的道德规范。提到的内容分别有：

1. 瓜田不纳履、李下不整冠
2. 路遥知马力、日久见人心
3. 雁过留声、人过留名
4. 树高万丈落叶归根
5. 从善如登、从恶如崩
6. 人为财死、鸟为食亡
7. 
8. 宁可清贫、不作浊富
