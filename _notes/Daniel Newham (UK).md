Daniel has been a resident of Beijing for over two decades. After completing a Master's Degree in Law at Renmin University, he began a career in online retail, heading up the European office of a Chinese enterprise in London. However, in 2019 the CoVid pandemic wreaked havoc worldwide: this presented many people with challenges and in some cases, life-changing opportunities. In this particular instance, a choice to leave the world of non-disclosure agreements, trade tariffs and international arbitration, and embark upon a journey into the world of Chinese art history. After a period of intensive study, taking classes in Chinese painting; seal carving and Chinese calligraphy, Daniel enrolled as a PhD. candidate at Tsinghua University. Studying under the eminent scholar, Qiu Caizhen (who has authored numerous books on the theory, history and appreciation of Chinese calligraphy), Daniel's thesis concerns the changing perceptions of Chinese calligraphy in Europe and North America.
