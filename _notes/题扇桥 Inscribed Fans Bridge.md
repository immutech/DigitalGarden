这里，再讲一个[[Wang Xizhi 王羲之]]的故事。
This is another story about Wang Xizhi.

在一个夏日的傍晚，王羲之走出家门，信步来到一座古老的石桥上。这时候，太阳快落山了。不少赶集的人都开始收拾东西准备回家。王羲之站在桥上，欣赏了一会儿夕阳的胜景以后，就走下桥去。正巧有一位拄着拐杖提着篮子的老太太，一瘸一拐地迎面走来，嘴里还不停的叫喊：“卖扇子喽！卖扇子喽！”

One sultry summer evening, Wang Xizhe went out to take a stroll, arriving at an ancient stone bridge. The sun was slowly setting. A great many market people were packing up their stalls and returning home for the night. Wang Xizhi stood at the top of the bridge, soaking in the last rays of a beautiful sunset until finally, he decided to descend. At just that moment, an old woman carrying a basket hobbled towards him, leaning heavily on her walking stick, calling out as she went: "Fans for sale! Buy a fan!" 

王羲之看见老太太那可怜的样子，就迎上去说：“老太太，天色这么晚了，您的腿又不方便，怎么还不回家去呢？”

Feeling sorry for the old woman, Wang Xizhi walked over to her and asked: "It's getting quite late, ma'am, and your legs look like they've seen better days, why don't you return home and rest?"

老人抬头，看了王羲之一眼，叹了一口气说：“相公，如今世道艰难呐！我们做小本生意的也倒霉！扇子没人买，一家老小没吃的······相公，您买把扇子吧！”

The old woman looked up at Wang Xizhi and sighed: "Sir, times are hard! I've been down on my luck as well! Nobody is buying my fans, and our family is going hungry...Sir, would you buy a fan?"

王羲之听了老太太的诉说，很同情她，就对她说：“老人家，您别急。我替您想个办法，准让您的扇子一下子就卖完了。”

Wang Xizhi listened attentively to the old woman's troubles and replied: "My dear, don't worry, I think I know a way to sell all of your fans in one go!"

说完，王羲之到附近人家借来了砚和笔，然后，提笔在扇子上写了起来。不一会儿，所有扇子上都提了字。

With that, Wang Xizhi went to a nearby house to borrow a pen and an inkstone. Then, he picked up his brush and began writing on the fans. Quick as a flash, all the fans were covered in inscriptions.

老太太起初有一些惊疑，担心扇子弄脏了更没人买。王羲之看到老人怀疑的表情，就笑着对她说：“老太太，您放心吧：只要您说一声这扇子上的字是王右军（王羲之的另一个名字）写的，就会有人买的。” 说完，王羲之就大踏步地走了。

The old woman was taken aback, worried that no one would buy the fans now that they were 'dirty'. Wang Xizhi noticed her flustered expression and chuckled, explaining: "Don't worry, ma'am: Just tell people that the inscriptions on these fans were written by Wang Youjun (Wang Xizhi's courtesy name) and people will buy them." and with that, Wang Xizhi strode off into the distance.

老太太拿着扇子来到集市，遇人就喊：“谁买扇子，上面有王右军的题字！”

The old woman brought the fans to the marketplace and called out: "Who wants to buy a fan with an inscription by Wang Youjun?"

果然，立刻就有好多人围了过来。人们仔细欣赏着扇子上的题字。个个称赞扇子上的字写得好，都愿意出高价购买。没有多长时间，一篮扇子立刻被抢购一空。老太太拿着钱，高高兴兴地赶回家去，逢人便夸姓王的相公是个大好人。这件事很快就在城里传开了。后来，人们就把王羲之题字的那座石桥称为“题扇桥”。

Sure enough, a huge throng of people descended upon her. They carefully examined the inscriptions on the fans. Everyone marvelled at the virtuosity of the brushwork and was willing to pay top dollar to own one. It wasn't long until the whole basket full of fans had been sold. Overjoyed, the old woman hurried home as fast as she could with the profits, telling everyone she met how kind the gentleman Mr Wang had been. The story soon spread and the stone bridge where Wang Xizhi wrote the inscriptions became known as the "*Inscribed Fans Bridge*".
