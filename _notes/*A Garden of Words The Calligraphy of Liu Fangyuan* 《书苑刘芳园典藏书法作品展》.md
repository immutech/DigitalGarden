I learned of this exhibition from the [[Huntington Chinese Garden]].This was  an exhibition held at the Huntington Gardens in [[The Studio for Lodging the Mind 寓意斋]]. Part One of the exhibition ran from August 28th to December 16th, 2021 and Part 2 ran from January 29th until May 16th 2022. The works on display were poetic couplets and name plaques that have been commissioned by the Chinese Garden over the course of the past 15 years. The original works on paper that were used as models for the wooden plaques, stone and tile inscriptions which adorn the Chinese Gardens were written by over 30 contemporary calligraphers from China, the US and the UK. 

The exhibition began by exploring the concept of what a Chinese character is, and then introduced the viewer to traditional tools: Brushes, Inksticks, Inkstones and Paper: i.e. the [[Four Treasures 文房四宝]] of the Scholars study. The third part of the exhibition introduced five major script types: Seal, Clerical, Regular, Running and Cursive. The fourth and final segement within the exhibition looked at how modern calligraphers are being innovative within the parameters of the tradition. 

A video of a calligrapher executing the character 永 in 5 different script types was used as an example to give the viewers a feel for the identifying charactersitics of each. To give viewers a sense of each calligraphers personality and the ethos behind their work, interviews of 8 calligraphers responsible for producing the work on show were available for viewing. [[Grace Chu 朱彰芳]] was one of the calligraphers interviewed. 

Throughout the course of the exhibition a series of lectures on Chinese calligraphy was given by prominent english speaking scholars in the field, namely:
