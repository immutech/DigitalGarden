广东端州（现在的肇庆市。肇 zhào）北郊，有一处景致叫“七星岩”。七星山山峰立在星湖中，山回水绕，风景非常优美。那里有不少具有艺术价值的石刻。比较有名的要算唐代书法家[[Li Yong 李邕]]的《*端州石室记*》（又叫《*马蹄碑*》）了。

In the northern suburbs of a place called Duanzhou (in the modern-day city of Zhao Qing, Guangdong Province), there's a scenic spot called '*Qi Xing Yan*', Seven Star Gorge. In this idyllic spot, the peaks of Seven Star Mountain rise majestically from the waters of Star Lake. The many stone inscriptions that can be found there are priceless works of art. One of the most famous inscriptions is the *Record of the Stone Chamber at Duanzhou*, also called the *Horse Hoof Stele* by the Tang Dynasty calligrapher, Li Yong.  

据说有一次李邕路过这里，被七星岩的美妙景色吸引住了。他仔细地游览了七星岩以后挥笔写成了《端州石室记》这篇380字的短文。文章朴素雄健，字体结构严谨端庄，笔划刚劲有力。

Word has it that one day, as Li Yong was passing, he was captivated by the stunning scenery of the Seven Star Gorge.  After having made a thorough tour of the area, he penned the 380-character essay: *Record of the Stone Chamber at Duanzhou*. The article itself is down-to-earth and sincere; the structure of the characters is precise and full of decorum; the brushstrokes are powerful and vigorous. 

后来又有传说：因为李邕骑马跑的太快，一时收不住，在石室岩洞口踩下一个深深的马蹄印。人们就把这块石刻叫“马蹄碑”了。

Legend has it that Li Yong was riding too fast, so when he reigned in the horse at the opening of the stone chamber in the gorge, one of the horse's hooves made a deep impression in the stone. That's why people call it the 'Horse Hoof Stele'.

李邕写成《端州石室记》以后看了看岩洞，又挥笔写成四尺见方的“景福”两个大字，并且请人把字刻在石室岩洞右下方的石壁上。后来有人干脆把石室岩改为“景福洞”。肇庆市的主要堤围取名“景福围”，直到现在还是用这个名字。

After finishing *Record of the Stone Chamber at Duanzhou*, Li Yong looked around inside the cave, picked up a brush and on a square piece of paper 4 ft long and 4ft wide, he wrote two large characters: *jing fu*, 'a fortuitous view'. He asked a stonemason to carve the characters into the lower right-hand corner of the Stone Chambers walls. Later on, people decided to call the Stone Chamber, '*jing fu dong*' the '*Cave with a Fortuitous View*'. Even now, the dike around Zhaoqing is still called the ‘Dike with a Fortuitous View’.
