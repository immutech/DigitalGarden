[[卢惠纹 Lu Huiwen]] first wrote about this subject in 2010 when invited to a conference in Chicago. 
At the beginning of the lecture prof. Lu shows a slide which uses the character *mu* 木 to demonstrate the evolution of script types from [[Oracle bone inscription 甲骨文]] to [[Bronze Inscriptions 籀文]]， to [[Seal Script 篆书]]， to [[Clerical Script 隶书]] （the [[隶变 Clerical Transformation]] mentioned by [[Bai Qianshen 白谦慎]] in the previous lecture: [[Some Thoughts on the Art of Chinese Calligraphy]]）, to Standard, Running and Cursive Scripts.

The topic of the lecture is [[Wild Cursive Script 狂草]]. Prof. Lu comments that the term *kuang cao* didn't appear until the 13th century, earlier terms for wild cursive which were in use during the Tang and Song dynasties included 草圣 （marvellous cursive） and 颠草 (mad cursive). Regardless of terminology, as an activity, wild cursive was often performed whilst intoxicated, accompanied by shouts and cries! The nature of such performances is well documented.  

As an example of wild cursive, prof. Lu displays an image of *[[Autobiographical Essay 自叙帖]]* executed by the Chan sect Buddhist monk [[Huaisu 怀素]] in 777 CE. This work is now in the collection of the [[National Palace Museum 台北故宫博物院]] in Taipei.

After showing the huge character *dai* and praising how it links not only brushstrokes from one character, but lends its strokes to the next character, remarking about how the style influenced later artists, prof. Lu presents us with a section of [[Chan Saying 诸上座帖]] by Song Dynasty calligrapher [[Huang Tingjian 黄庭坚]] and [[Ode to the Red Cliff 赤壁赋]] by Ming dynasty calligrapher [[Zhu Yunming 祝允明]]. 

To demonstrate the importance of this style of writing she also exhibits works by [[Xu Wei 徐渭]] and Ming dynasty theorist, and connoisseur [[Dong Qichang 董其昌]]. Moving into the Qing Dynasty, prof. Lu displays works by [[Wang Duo 王铎]] and [[Fu Shan 傅山]] （the topic of a book by [[Bai Qianshen 白谦慎]]).

After having waxed lyrical about the pure aesthetic exhilaration which wild cursive can bring its viewers, demonstrating its popularity with screenshots of the [[National Palace Museum 台北故宫博物院]] online shop which sells all kinds of derivative products, prof. Lu asks viewers if they feel that wild cursive is similar to the drip paintings executed by [[Jackson Pollock 杰克逊·波洛克]]in the 1950s? She points out that, unlike Pollock's abstract art, pieces of wild cursive calligraphy are still readable, they have their roots in Chinese characters. This is the position of [[Lothar Ledderose 雷德侯]] in his seminal work [[Ten Thousand Things 万物]].  Perhaps one of the biggest differences pointed out by prof. Lu is the viewers' ability to "relive the process of creation" for calligraphy. 

Evidently [[卢惠纹 Lu Huiwen]] doubts the authenticity of [[Four Ancient Poems 古诗四首]] by [[Zhang Xu 张旭]], as she posits that [[Autobiographical Essay 自叙帖]] is the earliest extant work of wild cursive script. 

Entering the main portion of her talk, prof. Lu first breaks down the structure. Her talk consists of three parts:

1. Craziness, Alcohol and Daoism
2. Mad Monks and Spiritual Powers
3. New Developments in the Ninth and Tenth Centuries

To illustrate what cursive calligraphy was like before the occurrence of Wild Cursive, Lu presents a quote from the [[Manual of Calligraphy 书谱]] by [[Sun Guoting 孙过庭]]:

	"This is why the work of Wang Xizhi in his late years is so marvellous; for by then, his thoughts were well considered and his intent and breath in perfect harmony and balance. Never agitated, never sharp, Wang's style and demeanour naturally resonate far"
	"是以右军之书末年多妙当缘思虑通审志气和平不激不厉而风规自远。"

In contrast to the Confucian values extolled by [[Sun Guoting 孙过庭]], the wild cursive calligraphers of the 8th century were a more liberal bunch, full of joie de vivre. 

[[Zhang Xu 张旭]] is one of the [[Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup 饮中八仙]] in a poem by [[Du Fu 杜甫]]. His exploits are said to have included dipping his head in ink and painting with his hair! This might be one of the reasons he acquired the sobriquet *Zhang Dian* 张颠 “Crazy Zhang”. 

[[Old History of the Tang 旧唐书]] was completed 186 years after Zhang Xus' death (945 CE) but prof. Lu sees fit to use a quote from the work to give us a deeper insight into the character of this free soul:

	“吴郡张旭善草书，好酒。每醉后，号呼狂走，索笔挥洒，变化无穷，若有神助”
	
	“A native of Wu, Zhang Xu is a master of cursive calligraphy, and he loves to drink. When he's drunk he howls and runs around, asking for a brush to brandish, the spontaneous changes within his work make one wonder if he is aided by something supernatural."

Citing [[An Ode to the Cursive Calligraphy of Zhang Xu《张伯英草书歌》]] a poem by [[Jiao Ran 皎然]] prof. Lu asserts that Zhang may have been a practising Daoist. If the [[Four Ancient Poems 古诗四首]] are anything to go by, then this is probably a valid point. 

Asides from the nickname *Zhang Dian*, he was also called the [[Spirit of Taihu 太湖精]], increasing the probability that his contemporaries held Daoist beliefs, in fact, the poem this comes from is [[For Zhang Xu 赠张旭]] by [[Li Qi 李颀]]：

	“张公性嗜酒，豁达无所营。皓首穷草隶，时称太湖精。”
	“Zhang was a drunkard, warm-hearted and honest: his white-haired head knew everything about cursive and clerical scripts. People called him the spirit of Taihu." 

Prof. Lu mentions some similarities between [[*Yipin* 逸品]] painters and Zhang Xu, saying that the way they painted was similar to "action painting", with an element of display involved, like performance art. Is this superficial? Prof. Lu thinks that the performance of Daoist rituals may have been a source of inspiration.

Moving on, prof. Lu moves to the second portion of her lecture: Mad Monks and Spiritual Powers. Citing poems about the Chan sect Buddhist monk who gained fame in Chang An around the 8th Century CE, she speculates that perhaps people of the time really did believe that he had the ability to know all past lives (通宿命). She notes that the metaphors used to describe his calligraphy, whilst still relying on common themes like old vines, dragons, boulders, etcetera, placed more of an emphasis on verbs, stressing the movement of the calligraphy.

Prof. Lu perhaps wrongly attributes a poem by [[Meng Jiao 孟郊]] to Jiaoran, again referring to poetry rather than looking at examples of calligraphy. The reason being that she wants to prove that some calligraphers don't need to become intoxicated (at least with wine) to perform wild cursive script. Incidentally, the poem is *[[Taking Cursive Calligraphy as a Gift on my Return to Lushan 送草书献上人归庐山]]* and one particular translation I encountered online seems to conflict with the explanation offered by prof. Lu., who believes that this is a poem about someone called 献上人 who is being taken back to Lushan by [[Jiao Ran 皎然]]. 

Moving on to the final section: New Developments in the Ninth and Tenth Centuries, again, citing a poem, this time by [[Ren Hua 任华]], Lu notes that during his stay in Chang'an [[Huaisu 怀素]] was treated as a celebrity by the nobility, and provided with luxurious accommodation.  The generosity he was shown, however, pales in comparison to that shown to the '[[wild cursive monks 书僧]]' of the 9th and 10th centuries:

- [[Gaoxian 高闲]]；
- [[Yaxi 亚栖]]；
- [[Bianguang 辨光]]; and
- [[Guanxiu 贯休]].

Each of these made a roaring trade in calligraphy with their works in high demand. However, perhaps due to their ubiquitous nature, decorating homes and tombs alike, (prof. Lu exhibits paintings which show cursive script being used decoratively in screens and on cloth during the Song dynasty), these works were scorned by the likes of [[Mi Fu 米芾]] and serious connoisseurs. The only calligrapher to continue the wild cursive tradition was [[Huang Tingjian 黄庭坚]], but as [[Peter Sturman 石慢]] has written, though inspired by the work of [[Huaisu 怀素]] Huang reinvigorated the style with his own unique twist, he:

	"Transformed the tradition of writing that had become synonymous with drunken unfettered ease and public exhibitionism into an intensely meditative practice."
	-Peter Sturman on Huang Tingjian
	
Additionally, the texts he chose to write in wild cursive were quite different from those written by past masters, who almost inevitably chose to render their version of the [[Thousand Character Essay 千字文]]. The final emperor of the Northern Song Dynasty, [[Zhao Ji 赵佶]] was the last emperor to write in the wild cursive style. His choice to write the *Thousand Character Essay* is a conventional one, but his style avoids the careless brushwork and wreckless abandon of the [[wild cursive monks 书僧]] mentioned earlier.

## Q&A

_Q_: What types of brushes did wild cursive calligraphers use?

_A_: Judging from extant examples, the brushes used to write wild cursive were the same as those used to write other script types.

_Q_: Are there any historical texts which discuss the difference between writing horizontally (on paper on a table) and vertically (e.g. on a wall)?

_A_: Not that she is aware of.

_Q_: How do the extant works of Gaoxian and Huaisu compare to the description of them in the poems you showed us?

_A_: Writing on walls or on screens was a common practice in pre-Tang calligraphy. Unfortunately, there are no extant examples.

_Q_: How did Wild Cursive Calligraphers make a living? Did they sell their works? Did they have patrons?

_A_: There are not many records about this. One of [[Huaisu 怀素]]s earliest patrons was a magistrate in his home town (in modern-day Hunan province).  When he garnered fame and travelled to the capital in Chang'an, there were many wealthy patrons which whom he stayed. 

_Q_: Can people still read wild cursive script fluently?

_A_: Yes. There are plenty of manuals available for youngsters if they want to learn cursive writing. It is by no means a lost art. All the loops may seem random to the uninitiated, but they follow a strict set of rules. 

_Q_: What is the connection between calligraphy and poetry? Did calligraphers compose their own poetry or write works by others?

_A_: Both. In the *Embodied Image* there is an essay by [[Robert Harrist]] about the relationship between calligraphy and poetry. Prof. Lu thinks that in order to fully appreciate a work of calligraphy, one should be able to understand the content as well as the way in which it has been executed. 

_Q_: Are there any extant examples of calligraphy written on linen?

_A_: There's a record of work written by [[Gaoxian 高闲]] but it has been lost to antiquity. I don't know of any other examples. 

_Q_: Are there any early manuals which teach the reader how to write cursive script which date back to the ninth and tenth centuries?

_A_: There aren't any manuals from Huaisu or Zhang Xu, but by the third generation of this style, students had mentors. 

_Q_: Was wild cursive ever considered to be so-called: "[[Ugly Calligraphy 丑书]]"? Could you comment on the phenomena of ugly calligraphy?

_A_: When it first gained prominence in the early 8th century it was a rebellion against the polished and refined style epitomised by the [[Wang Xizhi 王羲之]] tradition. So in the early days of its inception, it was a rebel, but gradually it became fashionable with the literati, and thus gained institutional support. Whether or not it was classed as ugly calligraphy is a subjective question and as such, very difficult to answer.

_Q_: What are you currently researching?

_A_: The transformation of [[regular script 楷书]] calligraphy between the Tang to the Song. Different perceptions of [[Wang Xizhi 王羲之]] during the Tang and Song dynasties. Another project is the perception of the old Tang capital Chang'an by the residents of Bianjing in the Northern Song.
