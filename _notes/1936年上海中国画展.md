1936年上海的评论家wen yuanning认为中国的展览布局非常不讲究，杂乱的布展让参观的人很难欣赏那些作品。布展远不如日本人，也不如伦敦的[[伯林顿俱乐部]]。艺术家如此重视构图，[[策展人]]怎么那么随便呢？

	“The first point that strikes any visitor to most Chinese Exhibitions of Paintings is the atrocious way in which the pictures are displayed. Nothing is done to show a painting to its best advantage. The exhibits seem to be hung up on no principle that we can discover: short and long, big and small, they are thrown together pell-mell. The result is anything but artistic. Under such circumstances, many beautiful pictures stand precious little chance of catching one's attention. In this respect, we have plenty to learn from the Japanese. With them every picture, without sacrificing a jot of its claim on the spectator's attention, contributes to the harmonious effect of the whole exhibition. . . . In the West too, they order things better than we do here. What a difference, for instance, between the way we displayed our exhibits for the London Exhibition of Chinese Art at Shanghai last year and Nanjing a few months ago, and the way they were displayed at Burlington House! Our manner of displaying our exhibits is not even a good shop man's way of displaying his goods."
