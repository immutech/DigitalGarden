When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. In learning to write, the pupil goes over with his pen what the teacher has outlined in pencil: so in reading; the more significant part of the work of thought is already done for us. This is why it relieves us to take up a book after being occupied with ours. And in reading, the mind is, in fact, only the playground of another's thoughts. So it comes about that if anyone spends almost the whole day in reading, and by way of relaxation devotes the intervals to some thoughtless pastime, he gradually loses the capacity for thinking; just as the man who always rides, at last, forgets how to walk. This is the case with many learned persons: they have read themselves stupid - says **Schopenhauer in the book Essays and Aphorisms.**

“当我们阅读的时候，另一个人替我们思考：我们只是简单重复他的思维过程。当我们学习写作时，学生用钢笔描老师提前用铅笔写好的内容：阅读也是如此；作者已经替我们完成了有重大意义的思想劳动。这就是为什么阅读比写作轻松。阅读时，我们的大脑不过是他人思想的乐园。如果某人终日阅读，为了放松心情将剩余的时间用于无脑的消遣的话，就会逐渐丧失思考的能力；竟日骑马的人终究会忘记如何行走。很多有学问的人便是如此：他们把自己读傻了。”

这种想法最早出现于[[柏拉图]]的《[[斐德罗]]》。

This is a theme that appeared very early on in western thought in works like [[Plato]]s [[*Phaedrus*]] and influenced societys opinion of the written word.
