伯英死后生伯高，
After the death of Boying, Bogao was born. 
朝看手把山中毫。
In the rays of dawn, he held a lofty brush.
先贤草律我草狂，
The cursive script of the sages was disciplined, mine is wild.
风云阵发愁钟王。
Zhong You and Wang Xizhi cowered before the gathering tempest.
须臾变态皆自我，
A master of lightning-quick transformations
象形类物无不可。
that resemble anything you care to imagine:
阆风游云千万朵，
legions of clouds surging with the storm;
惊龙蹴踏飞欲堕。
startled dragons stampeding, tumbling from the heavens;
更睹邓林花落朝，
Blossoms falling from the trees in Deng Lin. 
狂风乱搅何飘飘。
Oh, how the wild wind thrashes!
有时凝然笔空握，
Sometimes deep in thought, he holds the brush suspended in midair,
情在寥天独飞鹤。
like a lonely crane in the vastness of the sky, 
有时取势气更高，
Sometimes he seeks the high ground, 
忆得春江千里涛。
crashing down, roaring like the spring tides.
张生奇绝难再遇，
When will we see a talent like Mr Zhangs again?
草罢临风展轻素。
After the cursive script is finished, the light silk undulates in the wind. 
阴惨阳舒如有道，
Gloom and glow in perfect balance, 
鬼状魑容若可惧。
terrifying, like the faces of ghosts. 
黄公酒垆兴偏入，
Passing an old haunt of the seven worthies, Wang Rong became sentimental,
阮籍不嗔嵇亦顾。
bitter at the deaths of Ruan Ji and Ji Kang. 
长安酒榜醉后书，
The drunken calligraphy of Chang'ans biggest boozer
此日骋君千里步。
will take you on a journey of 10 thousand leagues in one bound.
