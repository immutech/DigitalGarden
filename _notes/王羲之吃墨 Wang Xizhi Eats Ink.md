王羲之小的时候，练字十分刻苦。据说他练字用坏的毛笔堆在一起成了一座小山：人们叫它“笔山”。他家的旁边有个小水池。他常在这水池里洗毛笔和砚台，后来小水池里的水都变黑了，人们就把这个水池叫做“墨池”。

When [[Wang Xizhi 王羲之]] was young, he worked very hard on his writing skills. Its been said when all the brushes he wore out practicing calligraphy were piled up high they looked like a little mountain: people called it "*Brush Mountain*". Next to his home there was a small pond. He'd often use the pond to wash his inkstone and brushes. After a while the water became black, so people called the pond the "*Ink Pool*".

长大以后，王羲之的字写的相当好了，还是坚持每天练字。有一天，他聚精会神在书房练字，连吃饭都忘了。丫环送来了他最爱吃的蒜泥和馍馍，催着他吃。他好像没有听见一样，还是埋头写字。丫环没有办法，只好去告诉他的夫人。夫人和丫环来到书房的时候看见王羲之正拿着一个沾满墨汁的馍馍往嘴里送，弄得满嘴乌黑。她们忍不住笑出了声。原来王羲之边吃边练字的时候，眼睛还看着字，错把墨汁当成蒜泥蘸了。

After he became an adult, Wang Xizhi was very good at writing, but he still kept up his habit of practicing everyday. One day he was so deep in concentration, writing in his study, that he forgot to eat. The serving girl brought in his favourite meal: buns with a garlic dip, and reminded him to eat something, but Wang Xizhi just continued writing as if he hadn't heard a thing. The serving girl had no choice but to report back to his wife. When his wife and the serving girl returned to the study, they saw that Wang Xizhi was holding a bun that had been generously dipped in ink, taking bite after bite. His mouth was the color of soot! They couldn't help but laugh. Wang Xizhi had been so absorbed by the characters he was writing that he mistook the ink for his garlic dip.

夫人心疼地对王羲之说:"你要保重身体呀！你的字写得很好了，为什么还要这样苦练呢？"

Feeling a little concerned for Wang Xizhi, his wife remarked: "You need to take better care of yourself! Your calligraphy is already fantastic, why are you still practicing hell for leather?"

王羲之抬起头，回答说：“我的字虽然写的不错，可那都是学习学习前人的写法。我要有自己的写法，自成一体，那就非下苦功夫不可。”

Wang Xizhi looked up from his desk, replying: "I know my calligraphy is pretty good, but I've just been studying the styles of our ancestors. I want to develop a style of my own, to make a mark, so I need to work harder."

经过一段时间的艰苦摸索，王羲之终于写出了妍美流利的新字体。大家都称赞他写的字象彩云那样轻松自如，象飞龙那样雄健有力，他也被公认为我国历史上杰出的书法家之一。

After a tough period of experimentation, Wang Xizhi finally found a new style of character that was both elegant and flowing. Everyone said his writing was like relaxed and self assured like the way we feel when we look on colourful clouds; vigorous and powerful like galavanting dragons in the sky. He is recognised as one of the greatest ever calligraphers in the history of China.
