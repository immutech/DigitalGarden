东汉的时候，还有一位书法家，叫[[刘德昇 Liu Desheng]]。他从小就爱动脑筋：碰到什么不懂的事，就反复琢磨或者去问父亲母亲，一直到弄懂为止。

During the Eastern Han Dynasty, there was a calligrapher by the name of [[刘德昇 Liu Desheng]]. From a young age, he loved to think about things: if there was something he didn't understand, he'd think about it or ask his mother and father, until he found an explanation. 

上学以后老师先教他学楷书，又教他写草书。他练了一段时间感到楷书太死板，写起来太慢；草书又太潦草，不容易认清楚。能不能把这两种字体结合起来呢？刘德昇又琢磨开了。他还把自己的想法告诉了老师。 老师鼓励他说：“你的想法很好，可以试试。坚持不懈的摸索下去，我相信你会成功的。”

When he began schooling, his tutor began by teaching him to write regular script, then he taught him cursive script. After studying them for a while, he found that the regular script was too rigid and writing was slow; the cursive script was too messy and difficult to read. Would it be possible to combine the two?  Liu Desheng started thinking again. He told his tutor about his idea. His tutor encouraged him, saying: "I think it's a marvellous idea, you should give it a try. If you keep up the good work, I'm sure you'll succeed."

从此，他常常把一个字的楷书体和草书体放在一起比较，然后挥笔书写，试着把这两种字体结合起来，寻找又不潦草又不死板的写法。

From that day on, he would often write the same character in regular and cursive scripts, comparing them side by side, then write with his brush, attempting to combine them into a script that was neither messy nor rigid.

有一次，刘德昇和父母亲一起吃饭。吃着吃着，他慢慢放下碗，用筷子在桌上划起来：一边划，一边嘴里还小声念着什么。

One day, Liu Desheng was eating lunch with his parents. As he was chewing his food, he slowly put his bowl down and began scribbling on the table with his chopsticks: scribbling and murmuring something barely audible. 

母亲看到他这个样子，以为他中了邪气，赶忙问他：“孩子，你怎么啦？是不是病了？”

His mother, witnessing the act and thinking he might be possessed, snapped at him: "What's wrong with you, boy? Are you ill?"

刘德昇回答说：“我没有病，我是在琢磨一种新的字体呢！”

Liu Desheng replied: "I'm not ill. I'm thinking about a new type of script!"

父亲听了，对他说：“你有雄心，当然很好。不过，你年纪还小，应该多练习写字，等把字写好了，再去琢磨新的字体也不晚。”

His father was listening and said: "You're ambitious and that's great. But you're still very young. You should devote more time to practising calligraphy. Once you've mastered the basics you'll have ample time to think about your new script."

刘德昇听了父亲的话，坚持不懈的练习书法的基本功，并且不忘探求新字体的写法。经过多年的努力，他终于写出一种既写的快又看得清楚的字，就是“行书”。刘德昇的行书很有名，后来很多有成就的书法家都学过他的行书。人们也就把“行书”说成是刘德昇创造的了。

Liu Desheng took his father's words to heart and diligently practised the foundations of calligraphy, not forgetting to experiment with ways of writing a new script. After many years of hard work, he finally developed a script which was both fast and easy to read: *running script*. Liu Desheng's running script is very well-known, and many notable calligraphers have studied it: that's why people say that Liu Desheng "invented" running script.
