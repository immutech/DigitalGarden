This term refers to a tradition:

	"in which political and religious concepts were transformed into material symbols. In this tradition, forms that we now call works of art were integral parts of larger monumental complexes such as temples and tombs, and their creators were anonymous craftsmen whose individual creativity was generally subordinated to larger cultural conventions."

*Wu Hung, Monumentality in Early Chinese Art and Architecture*

This is where many peoples perception of western calligraphy remains until this day.
