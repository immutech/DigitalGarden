_Drinking and Scribbling in the Garden: Xu Wei’s Wild Cursive Calligraphy_, 2021. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT-vMcK0K7c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT-vMcK0K7c)

[[Peter Sturman 石慢]]s lecture is principally about [[Xu Wei 徐渭]] whom he describes as an interesting but 'problematic' character. Sturman relates that since the Tang dynasty if not earlier, calligraphy has been referred to as someones "Heartprint": this is a reference to：

	“书，心画也。” --《扬子法言·问神卷第五》

Which is a sentence in scroll number five of *An Inquiry About Gods*, part of a larger work, *Exemplary Words of Master Yang* purportedly by Han dynasty philosopher and poet, [[Yang Xiong 扬雄]]. 

This is strongly related to the nature of calligraphy. To give his audience a better idea of how to understand this concept, Sturman introduces the simplicity of the brush: a handle made of any type of material with a tip made of animal hair, tapering to a fine point. As the ink is transferred to the page, the brush captures the nuances of how it is manipulated by the fingers, the wrist, the arm and the body. 

Conventions of stroke order mean that anyone who knows calligraphy can follow the path of the brush (like a roller coaster for the eye). 

	"One of the remarkable things about calligraphy is that it captures the process of the writing...When you really get into it it's almost like it's being written in front of your eyes...It has this immediacy that makes it incredibly expressive."

	"It's an elite art: you had to have been literate to really appreciate it, and the more literate you were, the more you would be able to understand the nuance that went into the making of the characters, whether it's in reference to earlier calligraphers, or simply in the way the brush was held. It's a remarkable art form that is both graphic and at the same time displays learning and erudition."

Having introduced the concept of elite art and the 'heart-print', prof. Sturman shows us three hanging scrolls in different collections (Suzhou Private Collection; Taipei NPM; and Forbidden City Museum Beijing) all of them different sizes, but with the same poem *Spring Garden, Evening Rain* each purportedly by [[Xu Wei 徐渭]], all stamped with the [[Gongsun Daniang 公孙大娘]] **xianzhang** in the top right-hand corner.

Prof. Sturman relates that further investigation into these three scrolls reveals his hypothesis: all three scrolls were completed on the same night and kept together for much of their lifetime.  Sturman reasons that if the three scrolls had been given to different recipients on the eve of their creation, the likelihood of all three surviving to the present day is small. 

Another thing prof. Sturman believes, is that the creation of the scrolls entertained an element of performance. Citing the work of [[Wang Dongling 王冬龄]] as an example, he shows photos of Wang performing large works of calligraphy in front of a large audience, many of them filming the process with smartphones.  [[Peter Sturman 石慢]] shows examples of [[Wang Dongling 王冬龄]]s *Chaos Script 乱书*. Moving back in time, before the topic of the lecture, namely [[Xu Wei 徐渭]], prof. Sturman presents us with a picture of the [[Four Ancient Poems 古诗四首]], purportedly by [[Zhang Xu 张旭]]. He attributes the work to some time around the Song Dynasty c.a. 1000. asking viewers to turn their attention not just to the beauty of the cursive calligraphy itself but also the vivid imagery conjured by the poems of [[Yu Xin 庾信]] and [[Xie Lingyun 谢灵运]], he gives the example of: "飘飘入倒景，出沒上烟霞" from [[The Daoist Master Strolls through the Empyrean 步虚词]], translated as: "...Wafting and floating, he enters Topsy-turvy land, Emerging and disappearing, ascending the rosy mists..."

Moving to the Song Dynasty, Sturman presents us with [[The Sage of Cursive Calligraphy 论草书]] by [[Mi Fu 米芾]]. Mi offers a stinging rebuke to the wild cursive styles of [[Zhang Xu 张旭]] and  [[Huaisu 怀素]], especially distainful of the 9th and 10th century [[wild cursive monks 书僧]] i.e. [[Gaoxian 高闲]] and [[Bianguang 辨光]]. To Mi Fu the [[Tradition of the Two Wangs 二王传统]] is the only style worth studying. For Mi at least, the old school is the best school. 

Continuing along this line of thought, prof. Sturman shows some slides of Northern Song dynasty landscape paintings by [[Li Cheng 李成]]. In the paintings we can see that in taverns and wine shops, people use cursive calligraphy as a decoration. This was an exciting style of calligraphy associated with places people went with the intent of getting a little tipsy.

Mi Fu was complaining about wild cursive calligraphy because it pandered to common tastes: in other words it was too plebian. How could the art of the elite cater to the masses? To prove that Mi was not alone in this criticism, prof. Sturman quotes a collophon, purportedly by [[Su Shi 苏轼]], which criticises both [[Zhang Xu 张旭]] and [[Huaisu 怀素]] basically calling them cheap whores:

	"Crazy Zhang and Drunken Su, those two (garrulous) fellows, chased shamelessly after the public fancy and called their calligraphy skillful. Even in their dreams they could not have laid eyes upon Wang Xizhi and Zhong You. Foolishly adorning themselves with powder and jewels to cheat the deaf and blind, like a street trollop smearing herself with red and blue make-up, performing a bewitching song and seductive dance to dazzle the eyes of the youngsters."

This raises the issue that not all wild cursive calligraphy is skillfully executed. Prof. Sturman stresses that Zhang Xu had already "proven his chops" in regular script as documented in [[Record of the Langguan Stone  《郎官石记碑册》]]. On his visit to Hangzhou, prof. Sturman was surprised when [[Wang Dongling 王冬龄]] showed him copies of his regular script calligraphy, almost as if he should prove his strong foundation to legitimize his more experimental work. Is it the case that you have to know how to follow the rules before you can break them?

Returning to the idea of authenticity and the 'heart-print', prof. Sturman questions the role of alcohol in relation to creativity, releasing one's true self, or finding one's real essence. This reminds me of the saying coined by Pliny the Elder in the 1st Century: [[In Vino Veritas 酒后吐真言]]. Prof. Sturman presents us with a 5th-century brick portrait of one of the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove 竹林七贤]]，[[Liu Ling 刘伶]] a Daoist poet whose name is now synonymous with wine. 

Returning to the subject of [[Xu Wei 徐渭]], prof. Sturman informs us that he was fond of drinking a little before performing calligraphy and in some ways, it was even expected of him. When he wrote [[Spring Rain and Courtesan Yang]] in 1567, Xu was languishing in a prison cell in Shaoxing, having bludgeoned his wife to death. In addition to his incarceration, [[Xu Wei 徐渭]] had the added calumny of having to wear a *Kang*, a stocks-like device depicted here:

![[Pasted image 20221201205907.png|500]]

Xu mentions in the dedication at the end of the scroll that the Zhang brothers (who came to visit) helped him hold up the Kang as he returned to his cell. After he is released from prison, he visits one of his influential friends, Zhu Dashou, presenting him with a handscroll, now in a private collection:

![[Pasted image 20221201210900.png|500]]

This scroll can be dated to 1573 and to prof. Sturmans knowledge has not been published anywhere. The scroll is a brushed ink painting of bamboo and flowers followed by calligraphy by Xu and ending with an inscription by Zhu, the handscrolls recipient. The poem goes:

忙笑乾坤幻泡沤，闲涂花石弄春秋。
花面年年三月老，石头往往百金收。
只开天趣无和有，谁问人看似与不？

Busy I laugh at the illusory world of bubbles and froth,
Casually painting flowers and rocks I pass the time away,
The blossoms wither each year in march, 
and the rocks I can sell for a hundred a piece. 
I'm simply following my nature -- emptiness and form,
Who cares if people can see a resemblance or not?

![[Pasted image 20221201214318.png]]

[[Xu Wei 徐渭]] considered himself a calligrapher above all else, putting his skill in calligraphy above his poetry, prose and painting. This drives home what a compound or comprehensive art calligraphy was considered to be. 

### Q&A

_Q_: What makes good cursive script?
_A_: People's opinions differ. Lots of people discuss [[Autobiographical Essay 自叙帖]] by [[Huaisu 怀素]],  some people say it's the best calligraphy ever, and others hate it. Prof. Sturman says that he found some deficiencies in [[Four Ancient Poems 古诗四首]] at the Liaoning Museum, just before the pandemic, pointing out that the brushwork has areas where it repeats itself, in his words a 'sameness'. "It's not that inventive, quite frankly." 
"You try to follow the brush, try to imagine the energy that went into it, you look at the composition, you look at the balance, you look at the change in the tonalities, you try to get into reliving the experience of the writing: If you're really attuned to it, you can sometimes see how there are limitations to the calligrapher...It's an incredibly difficult art form. Just to master the brush, then to learn the cursive forms, and then to be natural about it, to somehow capture that balance of discipline and naturalness."

_Q_: How did [[Xu Wei 徐渭]] learn calligraphy? 
_A_: We don't know a whole lot. He was from Shao Xing and often did paintings of [[Wang Xizhi 王羲之]]. He probably learned from [[model letters compendia 法帖]] just like everyone else. But he grew up in a family that wasn't wealthy so he may not have had access to very good copies. He would have learnt [[Preface to the Gathering at the Orchid Pavillion 兰亭集序]], but not ones like the Feng Chengsu copy. Sturman believes that he may have been influenced by [[Yang Ke 杨珂]], an influential wild cursive calligrapher also active in Shaoxing during Xu Weis lifetime, part of a group called the [[越中十子]]. 

During the Q&A, prof. Sturman notes that when he was learning Chinese Art in the US in the 70s, nobody was talking about Chinese calligraphy, and nobody seemed to be collecting it, so the work of Chiang Yee, despite its good reception had not allowed the vast majority of US citizens exposure to the art. 

_Q_: How was [[Xu Wei 徐渭]]s work recieved by subsequent generations of artists? 

_A_: When you go to exhibitions of Xu Wei's work in China, curators often pair him with a near-contemporary artist [[Chen Chun 陈淳]]. Chen Chun was a disciple of [[Wen Zhengming 文征明]]. The reason they are often paired, called [[Qing Teng Bai Yang 青藤白羊]] is that they were both [[Flower and Bird 花鸟]] painters and they both did wild cursive style calligraphy. Two years ago, (2019) Sturman visited an exhibition in Nanjing pairing [[Qing Teng Bai Yang 青藤白羊]], and then they had the 'aftermath': among the things on display were [[Zhe School Paintings 浙派画]]. It's easy to see how Xu was influenced by the Zhe School. As far as the influence he had on later generations of Chinese artists goes, [[Shi Tao 石涛]] and [[Bada Shanren 八大山人]] were clearly at the top of the list. When you look at the multiple scripts written by [[Shi Tao 石涛]], the way he changed modalities of calligraphy to suit certain subject matter, that inventiveness and display, that was learned from Xu Wei. Bada Shanren has word games which were a part of Xu Wei's playbook. 

_Q_: How did the act of murdering his wife affect people's reception of his work at the time?

_A_: Xu Wei wrote a commentary on a very difficult Daoist text on alchemy and claimed to have been transformed by the process, having unlocked the secrets of the universe. How much of this was self-promotion and how much was self-delusion? He mutilated his own body and yet survived. Was it some kind of resurrection narrative? It's evident that regardless of Xu Wei's intent, the narrative worked. His friends and admirers were completely in awe of him. There can be no question of his brilliance in prose, poetry, painting and calligraphy: he was a true polymath. Unfortunately, this meant that the crime was more or less just swept under the rug. It was  
an embarrassment, perhaps a little taboo, so people tended not to talk about it. 

One reason that Xu Wei is such a popular subject for study is that he is such a complex character, and people enjoy subjecting him to all kinds of Freudian psychoanalysis.

_Q_: How was mental illness perceived in Ming dynasty China, and how did his reputation as one who suffered from mental illness affect his reputation?

_A_: There's no way of knowing. There was an element of paranoia: Xu believed that his wife was cheating on him. There's no way to tell if he was schizophrenic, bipolar or depressed. Certain people viewed his 'illness' not as an affliction but perhaps as a gift, saying that it was one of the things that made him the strangest of all. Sturman thinks that perhaps his contemporaries were in awe of his various eccentricities. 

_Q_: How did artists decide on the size of their works? Are there any other examples of monumentally sized works of calligraphy in the Ming and Qing dynasties?

_A_: There are other works of calligraphy that are massive but they are quite rare. Prof. Sturman has seen works by [[Wen Zhengming 文征明]] that are extremely tall. This makes you think: "Where could they hang something like this?" Only somebody who had an awfully big house would be able to display a work of such size. "Obviously a person of great wealth".
