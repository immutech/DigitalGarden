[[Zhang Xu 张旭]]以后，又有一个以草书出名的书法家，就是和尚[[Huaisu 怀素]]。怀素本性钱，是湖南长沙人。因为家里穷生活困难，少年时代就出家当了和尚，改名叫怀素又叫藏真。唐朝有名的玄奘和尚就是他的师傅（这是原著里面的错，其实玄奘的徒弟不是同一个人）。

After Zhang Xu, there was another calligrapher famous for his cursive-style calligraphy: the monk Huaisu. Before he became a monk his surname was Qian, and he came from Changsha in Hunan province. Coming from a poor family, he was sent to a monastery to train as a monk at an early age. He changed his name to Huaisu, although he also had another name, Cangzhen. 

怀素不但勤奋好学，而且尊敬师父和师兄们。有一位师兄毛笔字写的非常好，小怀素就帮他磨墨。时间长了，怀素对书法也产生了浓厚的兴趣。有一天，他对师兄说：“师兄，你能教我写字吗？”

Huaisu was very hard-working and respectful towards his teachers and fellow students. One of the older monks in his order was a talented calligrapher. When he was a little boy, Huaisu would help him grind ink. Years passed and Huaisu became very interested in the art of writing. One day he asked the older monk: "Big brother, can you teach me how to write?"

师兄高兴地说：“行啊，只要你有恒心学我一定教。不过，你要先读书认字。”

The monk was pleased: "No problem! if you are willing to work hard and keep at it, I will teach you. But first, you need to learn to read."

从此怀素每天就跟着师兄一边读书，一边学书法。师兄开始教他写楷书，要求他正正规规地写。开始，小怀素还能按照师兄的要求办，时间久了，怀素觉得自己楷书写的可以了，就想练习草字。他对师兄说：“师兄，我想跟你学写草字······”

From that day on, Huaisu studied with the elder monk, reading and learning how to write. The elder began teaching him to write in the regular style, asking him to complete each character in accordance with strict rules. In the beginning, Huaisu did as the older monk asked, but as time went on, he thought that his regular style was good enough and wanted to learn to write in cursive script. He said to the older monk: "Big brother, I want you to teach me to write cursive script..."

没等怀素说完，师兄打断他的话说：“楷书是书法的基础，不练好楷书，其他字体你是写不成的，我教你草书你也写不出字的神态来。师弟，不管做什么事情，都要下苦功才行。”

The older monk interrupted: "Regular script is the foundation of all styles: without it, you won't be able to master the others. Even if I were to teach you cursive script, you wouldn't be able to execute it with bravado. No matter what you want to achieve, you have to pay your dues first, little man."

打这以后怀素写字比以前更刻苦了。不管是冬天还是夏天，他都按时完成师兄布置的功课，连生病了也不间断。当时纸是很贵重的。他为了节省纸特意在庙的周围种了好些芭蕉。芭蕉长大了，他就用芭蕉叶代替纸，在上面练字。后来人们都把他住的庙叫“**[[绿天庵]]**”。他还在木板上涂上漆来写字，写了又抹，抹了又写：日子久了，木板都被写穿了。

After that exchange, Huaisu worked even harder than before. Through the summer and the winter, even when he was feeling ill, he'd always complete the exercises given to him by the older monk. At the time, paper was very expensive. To save money he planted a ring of banana trees around the monastery. When the trees grew large enough, he'd use banana leaves instead of paper to practise calligraphy. Later, people called the monastery he lived in '*lv̀ tiān ān*', the Green Sky Monastery. He'd paint a wooden board with lacquer, so that he could write on it, then wipe it clean, repeating the process over and over again. He wrote so much that he wore through the wooden board.

为了开阔他的眼界，师兄叫他到各地游历，拜访[[Yan Zhenqing 颜真卿]]等当时一些著名的书法家，学习历代书法家留下的真迹。

The older monk suggested that he go travelling to broaden his horizons. Among others, he went to visit the famous calligrapher Yan Zhenqing and was able to study firsthand the writing of old masters passed down through the ages.

经过十多年的努力，怀素终于成为唐朝有名的书法家了。怀素的性情跟张旭差不多，也喜欢喝酒写字。他的草字上下呼应，象骤雨旋风，气势磅礴，被称为“狂草”。人们还把他和张旭并称为“颠张醉素”。

After over a decade of dedication and persistent struggle, Huaisu finally earned himself a name as one of the most prominent calligraphers of the Tang Dynasty. His temperament was like Zhang Xu, in that he liked to drink. His cursive style was perfectly balanced but, at the same time it was majestic like a tempest: people called it "Crazy Cursive". Because he was like Zhang Xu, people called them *diān zhāng zùi sù* which means: "crazy Zhang and drunken Su".
