苏利文认可吴昌硕的艺术风格受书法影响：
	
	”He was a powerful artist who used the strong colour and forms typical to structure compositions based on the calligraphic brushstrokes“

	“He came to live by his brush as a calligrapher (chiefly as a master of the "stone drum" seal script of the early Zhou dynasty)” [^1]

日本人非常欣赏[[Wu Changshuo 吴昌硕]]（也喜欢[[Qi Baishi 齐白石]]）。当时上海经常有人派专车拉着吴昌硕和他的学生[[Wang Geyi 王个簃]]到日本人的家里参加晚宴。
