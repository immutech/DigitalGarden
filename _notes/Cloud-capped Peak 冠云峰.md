	"Emperor Huizong was notorious for setting up the so-called 'Flower and Rock Network': this was a group of officials with permission to purchase, acquire and ship exotic plants, fancy rocks like this one, all these things were taken up to the capital in Kaifeng to be set up in his imperial park. In 1105, there was a local office of the Flower and Rock Network set up in Suzhou, and it is said that this rock was dredged up from the lake bottom, and was supposed to join the Flower and Rock Network and be taken up to the capital, but was, for whatever reason, abandoned. And so this rock lay on the edge of the lake for many, many years, and then, closest to the establishment of Liu Yuan, Xu Tai's father-in-law put together the money, the men and the boats to raise this thing off the lake bottom, and he kept this at his place in Huzhou, on the other side of the lake, and then somehow, Xu Tai wanted it and so it was taken back across the lake to Suzhou and installed in the Eastern Garden."
