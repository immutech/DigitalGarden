_Calligraphy in the Lingering Garden, Suzhou_, 2021. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVGdROc8UZA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVGdROc8UZA).

When asked if she could give a talk about "Calligraphy in the Garden", the first thing which sprung to prof. McNair's mind was [[留园 The Lingering Garden]] in [[Suzhou 苏州]]. 

She begins the lecture by asking what the garden meant to its owner, and why was is called 留园. Before answering these questions, though, prof. McNair provides a summary of the ownership of the garden:

### Owners

 1. The garden was built by [[Xu Taishi 徐泰时]] in 1593 (Late Ming Dynasty). When he built it, he called it 东园, because at the time he had another garden to the west of his mansion called 西园. 

2. The gardens' owners changed 200 years later, during the Qing Dynasty. [[Liu Shu 刘恕]], a retired official, gained ownership in 1797. He decided to rename the garden as [[Cold Jade Manor 寒碧庄]], because of a line of poetry: **"竹色清寒，波光澄碧"**. However, it was more popularly known as [[刘园 The Liu Family Garden]]. The garden was abandoned during the [[Taiping Rebellion 太平天国起义]] （1860-1）and remained without an owner until 1873. 

3. In 1873, the garden changed hands yet again, being purchased by [[Sheng Xuanhuai 盛宣怀]]s father, [[Sheng Kang 盛康]]. After 3 years of renovations, the garden was renamed [[留园 The Lingering Garden]].

### Features

None of the following features is unique to [[留园 The Lingering Garden]].

##### Strange Stones 怪石

One of the most iconic features of the garden is the [[Cloud-capped Peak 冠云峰]], a 6.5m tall [[Lake Tai Rock太湖石]]. 

##### Plaques 匾额

These are horizontal tablets, usually made out of brick or stone with inscriptions on them. 

##### [[Stone Calligraphy Slab 书条石]]

These are engraved with calligraphy and embedded into the walls. 

Prof. McNair raises the question: "Why collect stone slabs rather than just collecting ink rubbings?"

The answer is that this is part of a "display culture". Stone slabs engraved with calligraphy are:
	- expensive;
	- difficult to acquire;
	- a proof of erudition and culture;
	- a status symbol.

By embedding the slabs in the walls of the garden, [[Liu Shu 刘恕]] was able to display his entire collection of [[model letters compendia 法帖]] all at once, something that would not be practical with works on paper or silk. 

Walking around the garden and talking about various *fǎtìe* would be a recreational activity that displayed one's erudition, and could be partaken in by anyone visiting the garden. By including calligraphy you had written into the collection you could become part of the great literati tradition by association. could this be an early exercise in personal branding by [[Pablovian Association 巴夫洛夫式联想]]?

Introducing one of the plaques of the garden, the [[Small Building In the Flowery Dock 华步小筑]], McNair reveals that the literary origin of the plaque lies with a line from [[Wary of People 畏人]] a poem by [[Du Fu 杜甫]]:

畏人成小筑，褊性合幽栖。
"Wary of people, I made a small building. My odd nature is suited to lodging hidden"

The plaque was presented as a gift to [[Liu Shu 刘恕]] upon completion of the garden. After the four main characters executed in [[Clerical Script 隶书]], a smaller inscription reveals more about the author of the plaque:

	"Where my friend Rongfeng (Liu Shu) situated his villa, in the Flowery Dock neighbourhood of flourishing Wu (Suzhou) is said to be the old home of Lord Xu, the Chief Minister of Ming. The ponds and rocks of this place with its rampant flowers and trees, have rather the flavour of the Hao river."

Prof. McNair notes that the reference to the Hao river is alluding to [[Autumn Water 秋水]], the record of a conversation between [[Huizi 惠子]] and [[Zhuangzi 庄子]], in which they are looking at fish swimming in the [[Hao River 濠水]] speculating about whether the fish are happy or not. The inscription continues:

	"Now he has repaired and added to the site somewhat: There are pavillions for enjoying the moon; and halls to store his books. He invites old friends here to drink and write poetry. Truly, this is one of the splendid sites of Suzhou. 
	
	- written by Qian Daxin, the Hermit of Zhuding, in the first month of the dingsi year of the Jiaqing era (1797)."

This shows that this plaque was written by [[Qian Daxin 钱大昕]] who was a celebrated calligrapher, his [[Clerical Script 隶书]]
being particularly popular. 

The first plaque that one encounters on visiting the garden today is: [[长留天地间 Remaining on Earth a Long Time]]. This alludes to another poem by [[Du Fu 杜甫]], about seeing off a friend who is retiring from court life in Chang'an. The poem is full of Daoist symbols like dragons and the immortals of [[Penglai 蓬莱]]. The line the plaque comes from is:

巢父掉头不肯住，东将入海随烟雾。  
诗卷*长留天地间*，钓竿欲拂珊瑚树。

So, the owner of the garden, [[Sheng Kang 盛康]] might be referring to this line of poetry when he makes the decision to call the garden [[留园 The Lingering Garden]]. The original author of the script was [[Zhou Boqi 周伯琦]], an expert in [[Seal Script 篆书]]. This plaque was treasured by [[Sheng Kang 盛康]]. 

### Q&A

_Q_: How did [[Liu Shu 刘恕]] aquire the [[Stone Calligraphy Slab 书条石]] with [[model letters compendia 法帖]]？

_A_: You had to know who owned them and you had to make a deal with those people. Sometimes they were gifts as part of a diary. Usually, they were not a complete set.  The owner of the [[Garden of the Master of Nets 网师园]] didn't like [[Stone Calligraphy Slab 书条石]] so he sold his sets.

_Q_: What fueled the craze for antiquarianism and 金石学 in the 18th century?

_A_: Confucian Scholars at the time believed that over the centuries, Confucianism had been polluted by the doctrines of Buddhism and Daoism. Re-examining Han dynasty texts, scholars got excited about the artistic potential of [[Clerical Script 隶书]] and [[Seal Script 篆书]], which came back into fashion.  Scholars got caught in a frame of mind that valued age above all else: "the more ancient the better".  A trend of using antiquated script types as an inspiration for calligraphy was further strengthened by the discovery of oracle bone inscriptions.

_Q_: How do you go about teaching Chinese calligraphy to western students?

_A_: It's good to have students attempt to describe differences in style because this is something that anyone can do regardless of whether or not they can or cannot read Chinese.

_Q_: What reading do you assign students?

_A_:  [[Lothar Ledderose 雷德侯]] article about Daoism. This reveals a religious/spiritual aspect of calligraphy to students. [[Chapter 17 Story of the Stone 红楼梦第十七回]]: this gives Western students a good idea about how Chinese gardens are named, and how the opulent classes lived.
