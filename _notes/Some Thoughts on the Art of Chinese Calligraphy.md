This was a lecture given by [[Bai Qianshen 白谦慎]] Sept. 11, 2021 as part of series of lectures to accompany the exhibition [[*A Garden of Words The Calligraphy of Liu Fangyuan* 《书苑刘芳园典藏书法作品展》]] at the [[Huntington Chinese Garden]] in California, US.

At the beginning of the Lecture, Prof. Bai stresses that despite having studied Chinese Calligraphy for over 40 years, he still has many questions about the unique artform, which are yet unresolved.

The first slide raises the issue of the tentative use of the term "calligraphy" used to describe 书法. Prof. Bai demonstrates that the Swiss Scholar, [[François Billeter 毕来德]] was aware of the issue in 1990 when he wrote *The Chinese Art of Writing*.

The second slide makes Bai's assertion that: "the use of the term "calligraphy" to describe 书法 if a mistake" even more explicit by quoting a book review by Simon Leys, in the author describes calligraphy as meaning: "a mere decorative craft". This may not be a definition which modern practitioners all agree upon. 

Prof. Bai continues by quoting from Roy C. *L’Amour de la Peinture: Goya, Picasso et autres Peintres. Gallimard; 1956.*

	"If I were born Chinese I would not be a painter but a writer. I'd write my pictures." -Pablo Picasso

laying out the thesis that Chinese civilization has "one more art" than the West, Prof. Bai poses the two following questions:

_What made writing the most treasured fine art in traditional China?_
_When did writing gain such an exalted social status?_

Displaying characters from the Neolithic and Shang periods, Prof. Bai proves that the earliest readable script can be traced back to the 1200 BC and even longer. Oracle bone inscriptions can be classed as chinese characters, but are they calligraphy, are they 书法？

After making comparisons of various pictographic and hieroglyphic scripts in other civilizations across the globe: Mayan; Egpytian and Indus, Prof. Bai remarks that Chinese is exceptional in that it is the only text which did not succumb to the trend of alphabetization, remaining ideographic rather than phonetic. 

After having shown a chart from the book on cursive Chinese by [[王方宇 Fred Fangyu Wang]], which demonstrates the evolution of the various types of script, Prof. Bai contrasts two ideograms for a fish, which as time passes becomes more and more abreviated:

![[Pasted image 20221127153125.png]]

One of the largest steps forward in the evolution of Chinese characters was that of Seal script into Clerical script, a process referred to in Chinese as [[隶变 Clerical Transformation]]. This is a change that occured between 400 BC and 200 AD. The reason this change was so radical was that all pictorial elements began to disappear, gaining functionality (speed of execution), sacrificing a ritualistic element. Characters were used to document everyday occurrences, not just inscriptions on bronze vessels and stone tablets. This is exactly the change that was lamented by the [[Jesuits]] and in the [[Extract from the Journals of the Royal Society, June 23, 1768]].

This process of [[隶变 Clerical Transformation]] was an amalgamation of strokes with a horizontal trend. New strokes such as the *pǐe* (撇) and *nà* (捺) were born. 

![[Pasted image 20221127154856.png]]

According to Prof. Bai, the catalyst behind this trend was a transition from feudal system to a beaurocratic system. This terminoligy is a little confusing if you take into consideration that the feudal system was still used in China until the fall of the Qing Dynasty circa 1912. Still, Prof. Bai says that a beaurocratic system was evolving between 400 BCE and 200 CE from the [[Warring States Period 春秋战国]] until the [[Han Dynasty 汉朝]]. Efficiency of communication was the driving force behind the transition. Bamboo strips with [[early cursive writing 章草]] demonstrate the trend of abbreviation and swift execution which became a necessity in a country whose governance relied on documents. 

When we look at bamboo strips from the Qin and Han dynasties, the strokes which make up each character have varying different lengths and shapes, very much unlike [[Seal Script 篆书]] which was rooted in a uniformity, having similar rounded ends and uniform width. The seemingly casual execution of cursive characters betrays more sophisticated brushwork: twisting; turning; pausing; lifting and pressing. In terms of brushwork, a larger 'vocabulary' increased the expressive potential of Chinese characters. In the words of [[Lothar Ledderose 雷德侯]]: 

	"the aesthetic potential of the brush-strokes was developed step by step over the following centuries."

[[Bai Qianshen 白谦慎]] notes that by the first century AD, some people's writings became collectables. This is a trend that has continued ever since. The article [[*A Condemnation of Cursive Writing 《非草书》**]] confirms that people were pursuing the art of writing for aesthetic purposes during the Han Dynasty. This assertion, although implied by [[*A Condemnation of Cursive Writing 《非草书》**]], becomes explicit in a letter from [[Wang Xianzhi 王献之]] to Emperor Jianwen (371 AD), in which he suggests that the Emperor keep the letter as an example of good calligraphy. 

Other factors which contributed to the aesthetic evolution of Chinese characters were more materialistic: [[Brushes 毛笔]] were constantly improving； the development of [[Paper 纸]] and [[Silk 绢]] meant that the writer had a larger "canvas" on which to experiment, allowing for greater fluency (no need to pick up another bamboo strip after the previous one was finished), and more freedom in terms of the overall 'shape' of a composition (章法上的自由). 

Prof. Bai remarks that from the 3rd to the 5th Century CE, there have been Chinese "Odes to Paper", poems and prose which praise its quality. 

Bai lists some other authors who have written about how Chinese writing came to be regarded as a fine art in religious and cultural contexts, these include:[[Jonathan Chaves 齐皎瀚]]，[[Lothar Ledderose 雷德侯]],[[Cong Wenjun 从文俊]] and [[Feng Shi 冯时]].

By the 3rd and 4th centuries, around the time of the [[Wei and Jin Dynasties 魏晋时期]]， shu was already a recognized visual artform among the educated elite, the men of letters or the so-called [[Literati 文人]]. This is a position supported by [[Wu Hung 巫鸿]]：

![[Pasted image 20221127170351.png]]

In his observation that before the Han dynasty, the written language of China belonged to a '[[ritual art tradition]]', Wu Hung unwittingly points out one of the main reasons why calligraphy has been regarded more as a craft than as an art form in occidental tradition, this stems from explored by [[Plato 柏拉图]] in [[Phaedrus]].  

Continuing to quote from Simon Leys's article *One More Art*, prof. Bai remarks that:

"Calligraphy in the narrow sense of the word -- i.e., writing  considered as an artistic pursuit, as a means of self-expression, and an outlet for the calligrapher's individual sensitivity -- began to develop at the end of the Han period (third century AD): from that time on, it progressively turned into a  specialized discipline, with its masters, theoreticians, critics, collectors, and the leading position among the visual arts."

I would contend that the third century AD is perhaps two centuries too late, as [[*A Condemnation of Cursive Writing 《非草书》**]] proves. The stories of [[Cai Yong 蔡邕]] creating [[Fei Bai 飞白书]] also suggest an earlier origin than 200 AD. 

Prof. Bai still has some questions which linger in his mind and he doubts that there will ever be a satisfactory answer:

	- Where is the boundary between functional writing and visual art?

Many of the earliest extant examples of outstanding calligraphy, works like the [[Jiangjun Tie 将军帖]] and [[Yatouwan Tie 鸭头丸帖]], [[Shiqi Tie 十七帖]], etc, are all letters. 
A whole Juan of the [[Daguan Tie 大观帖]] is dedicated to letters by [[Wang Xianzhi 王献之]]. One example that prof. Bai shows is the [[Sangluan Tie 丧乱帖]] by [[Wang Xizhi 王羲之]]， now part of an imperial collection in Japan. 

Another observation made by prof. Bai during the lecture is that the best examples of running script calligraphy which have served as famous models (i.e. the [[Preface to the Gathering at the Orchid Pavillion 兰亭集序]]，[[Eulogy to My Nephew 祭侄文稿]]， and [[Poems Written in Huangzhou during the Cold Food Festival 黄州寒食帖]]) have all been drafts. This raises the following question:

	- Were calligraphers consciously creating art when they wrote drafts or were the drafts simply recognized to be works of art post facto?
	- What kind of a role does artistic intent play in calligraphy?

Prof. Bai puts forth the idea that this depends on the script type used. For example, [[Seal Script 篆书]] has not been used for functional communication for centuries, as such, anything written in this script is an intentional effort to make something pleasing to the eye. The example he uses is seal script on a folding fan written by [[Wu Dacheng 吴大澂]]。

![[Pasted image 20221128124710.png]]

In ancient times, the brush and paper were used for communication, they were standard items of stationary, whereas nowadays these tools can only be purchased at specialist art stores. People communicate via electronic devices, writing text messages and emails. Anyone writing brush calligraphy must have some kind of artistic intent. This contradicts the principles of [[Su Shi 苏轼]] who stated：

	“书初无意于佳乃佳尔”

"Writing devoid of a deliberate intent to strive for excellence is excellent precisely because of that spontaneity."

Bai stresses that the reason this is true for calligraphy but not for other art forms, such as sculptures and bronze vessels, is because calligraphy places huge aesthetic importance on a sense of immediacy, spontaneity and unexpected outcomes (factors beyond control) in the writing process. Accidental "masterpieces" were possible in the world of Chinese calligraphy because they were seen to be reflections or embodiments of the mind behind their genesis. Bai quotes prof. [[Wen Fong 方闻]] saying that calligraphy is the *embodied image*, the: 

	"embodiment of the person behind the writing: the character within the character of the character" 

The final issue explored in prof. Bai's lecture is the social function of Chinese calligraphy. What was it for? To answer this question, prof. Bai turns to the eminent German scholar [[Lothar Ledderose 雷德侯]] who penned two articles *Chinese Calligraphy: Art of the Elite* and *Chinese Calligraphy: Its Aesthetic Dimension and Social Function*. Quoting from this article, Ledderose reasons:

	"As soon as the literati made their appearance in the first centuries AD, the aesthetic dimensions in the practice of writing began to be explored. Writing was turned into calligraphy. In doing this, the literati helped foster the social cohesiveness of their class, which in turn was a prerequisite for political cohesiveness and stability. If this thesis about the social function of calligraphy is correct, it then follows that the particular features of Chinese calligraphy -- those which are unique in a perspective of world art, and which cannot be found in European or Islamic writing, for example -- are precisely those features that engender social cohesiveness. "

these features are listed as:

1. the factors of time and movement in a work of calligraphy;
2. the technical and stylistic cohesiveness in the artistic tradition;
3. the mode of transmission of canonical masterpieces.

prof. Bai accepts this thesis and goes on to relate that "a major social function of Chinese calligraphy was to reinforce the cohesiveness of the elite." Even in cases where calligraphy was not gifted but sold, such transactions were limited to the upper echelons of society.
 
 # Q&A
In the Q and A section of the talk, in reply to the question: 

	"Can you tell if a piece of calligraphy is written by a left hand or right hand?" 
	
Prof. Bai replies that he cannot. In Boston, he once taught Chinese calligraphy to western students, but even left-handed among them learnt Chinese calligraphy with their right hands.

Q: "How do you judge if a work of calligraphy is good or bad?"

A: Lothar Ledderose once remarked that all calligraphers had learnt from a similar set of models, and by studying these models they acquired a 'veterans framework' which could be used as a reference point in judging other samples of Chinese calligraphy. Skill and competence are judged within this framework. Bai says that the Chinese diaspora [[Hsiung Ping-ming 熊秉明]] once noted that, technical issues aside, the most important aspect of a piece of calligraphy is its spiritual dimension. 

Q: What is Chinese calligraphy's status in the 20th century?

A: Calligraphy used to play an important role in classist structures like the imperial court and the republican government. It had institutional support. This is no longer the case. Calligraphy is no longer the prerogative of the elite. Modern calligraphers make much less than modern artists at auction. The social status of calligraphy has been depleted. 

Q: What's the best introduction to calligraphy for a westerner?

A: Chinese Calligraphy by [[Chiang Yee 蒋彝]]. Despite having some mistakes, it is very well written.  Tseng Yu-ho's book is also mentioned. Bai says that it is more informative than Chiang Yee's one.
