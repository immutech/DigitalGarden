宋朝的时候，有一个诗人、书法家，名字叫[[Huang Tingjian 黄庭坚]]，又叫山谷道人。

During the Song Dynasty, there was a famous poet and calligrapher by the name of Huang Tingjian. He was also called *Shangu Daoren*, or the 'Taoist of the Valley'.

黄庭坚是个虚心好学的人：他不但向[[Yan Zhenqing 颜真卿]]、[[Huaisu 怀素]]等有名的书法家学习，而且很注意观察日常生活中的各种现象，向劳动者学习。

Huang Tingjian was a modest man with a curious mind. In addition to absorbing styles from the works of Yan Zhenqing and Huaisu, he looked to everyday life for inspiration in his calligraphy, learning even from the lowest rungs of society.

有一次他到一位朋友家去，赶了半天路来到一条大河边。涛涛的河水挡住了去路。他正在发愁的时候发现远处有一条船向岸边驶来。他高兴极了，立即向船工打招呼。船靠岸了，他很快就上了船。

One day he was on his way to visit a friend. About halfway, he came to the banks of a big river. The turbulent waters blocked his path forwards. Just as he was pondering how he might move on, he spotted a boat in the distance. It was approaching the river bank. Brimming with joy, he hailed the ferryman. the boat docked and he wasted no time jumping on board. 

开船了，黄庭坚看着船工们划桨的动作。桨在水中拔水的姿态，是多么有节奏、自然、生动啊！他目不转睛的看呐，看呐。仿佛船工们手握着的不是木桨，而是笔，涛涛的江水就是一大张纸。这些船工在不停地划动中写出了无数优美的草字。他想，要是自己也能写出这样优美的字来，该多好哇！

The boat left the river bank, and Huang Tingjian watched how the ferryman moved his oar. The way the oar sliced through the water was so rhythmic, natural and expressive! He watched, spellbound. It was as if the ferryman wasn't holding an oar, but a brush and the rippling currents of the river were like a huge piece of paper. The ferrymen were writing line upon line of cursive calligraphy as they rowed through the waves. He thought to himself: if only I could write like that. Wouldn't that be something?

黄庭坚想的正入神的时候穿已经到了对岸，可他还是站着不动。船工高声地说：“相公，到岸了，请您赶快上岸吧。”

Standing still, Huang Tingjian was still deep in thought when they reached the opposite side of the river. The ferryman shouted to him: "We've arrived, Sir. It's time to get off."

黄庭坚这才醒悟过来。他连忙道歉，说：“对不起，我想写字想迷了，耽误了你们的开船时间。”说完，黄庭坚上岸继续赶路。一路上他还在想怎么样象船工划桨那样，写出优美的草书来。

As if waking from a dream, Huang Tingjian apologised profusely: "I'm sorry, I was just daydreaming about calligraphy. I didn't mean to cause a delay." With that, Huang Tingjian disembarked and continued on his journey. On his way, he couldn't stop thinking about making beautiful cursive writing like the patterns of the ferrymen's oars in turbulent waters.
