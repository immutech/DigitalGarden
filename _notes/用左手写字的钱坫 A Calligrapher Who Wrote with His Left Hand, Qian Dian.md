清朝的时候有一个会用左手写字的书法家，名字叫[[Qian Dian 钱坫]]，又叫钱献之。

During the Qing Dynasty there was a calligrapher who wrote with his left hand called Qian Dian, he was also known as Qian Xianzhi. 

钱坫晚年得了一场病。病后，他的右手落下毛病，不能动弹了。他痛苦极了，整夜整夜地睡不着。心想：难道我就这样放下我终身爱好的书法吗？不。我的右手残废了还有左手。为什么不能用左手写字呢？

When Qian Dian was an old man an illness he suffered left him with a paralysed right hand. Grief-stricken, he spent many a sleepless night lamenting. He thought to himself: does this mean that I have to give up writing calligraphy, something that I have loved all my life? No. If my right hand is paralysed, I'll use my left hand! What's stopping me from using my left hand to write calligraphy?

从那时候起他下定决心练习用左手写字。开始每写一个字他都要花很大的力气，累的头上冒出小汗珠。写出的字歪歪斜斜，像小孩子写的一样。钱坫看了自己写的字很难过，把写字的纸撕得粉碎。

From that day on, he began practising using his left hand to write. His first attempt was a huge effort, and he was so tired that his brow was covered in sweat. The characters were disfigured and lopsided, like those of a toddler. Qian Dian was so disappointed that in a flash of rage, he tore the paper to shreds. 

他的老伴安慰他说：”你右手写字花了几十年的功夫，现在换成左手写字，就跟重新写字一样。不经过苦练，哪能把字写好哇？”

His wife comforted him, saying: "You spent decades of hard work training your right hand, now you're using your left, it's like starting from scratch. How can you expect results without hard work?"

钱坫听了老伴的话，心里亮堂多了。打这以后，他每天天蒙蒙亮就起床，开始练字，一练就是几个时辰，左手累的发抖了，就稍歇一会儿，接着再写。为了加强腕力，他特意在笔杆的顶端安上了几个大铜钱。

Qian Dian took his wife's words to heart and felt as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. After that, he could rise at dawn to practice, and continue for hours on end. When his left hand began to shake with fatigue he would rest a while, then continue to write. To strengthen his wrist, he added extra weight to the brush handle: a big copper coin. 

就这样，钱坫刻苦练习了三年多，终于用左手写出了非常漂亮的字来。

After three years of hard work, Qian Dian was finally able to write beautiful calligraphy with his left hand.
