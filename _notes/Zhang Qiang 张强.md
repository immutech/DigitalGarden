	“The calligraphy of the modern period is more approachable for Westerners as a result of changes in both Western and Chinese aesthetics. In particular, developments in Western abstract art and the increasing influence that Western art has had on many Chinese calligraphers have helped narrow the gap in artistic taste.” (Barrass, 2002: 11)

The fact that Chinese calligraphy is now more ‘approachable’ is apparently dependent on how a Western perspective has been facilitated within the Chinese context. In fact, arguably, Asian calligraphy remains ‘exotic’ to the West (though not highly valued) and, with respect to the machinations of the art world, the status of the calligrapher as artist is really only recognized within the Asian context. [^1]

	“白若思的说法也有一些盲目。中国书法现在更“平易近人”，这一事实显然取决于西方观点在中国语境中是如何被促进的。事实上，可以说，对于西方来说亚洲书法仍然属于“异国情调”（虽然不被高度重视），并且，令艺术界感到诡异的是，书法家作为艺术家的地位实际上只是在亚洲范围内才能得到承认。”

When I look at the works of Zhang Qiang all I see is someone who has exploited the superstitious pseudo-mystic psycho babble of the avant-garde literature in the west and twisted it to suit his purposes. He invents new terms to describe his practice, so called bi-directional 'callligraphy' and traceology (踪迹学). Just as well, because despite the efforts of some art critics to describe this as calligraphy, it is at most some form of abstract expressionism: this is something which the Chinese Calligraphers Association,  Sherman Lee, Fu Shen and Chiang Yee would all agree on.
