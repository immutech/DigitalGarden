在这里，讲一个清朝书法家[[Liang Tongshu 梁同书]]的故事。

This is a story about Qing Dynasty calligrapher Liang Tongshu.

梁同书又叫梁山舟。他的名声很大，当时日本，朝鲜等国的使节都争着出高价买他的手迹。他每天都收到好多求他写字的信。有的人劝他说：

Liang Tongshu was also known as Liang Shanzhou. He was very famous. Diplomats from Japan and Great Joseon (the old kingdom of Korea) would have paid handsomely to own a sample of his calligraphy. Every day his office was inundated with requests. Someone was bold enough to make the  suggestion:

> “古代的书法家都有代笔人，先生的书法这样值钱，请您写字的人这么多难于应付：您何不也请个代书人，您只要签上名字就行了。”

>"In the old days, calligraphers all had ghostwriters: your calligraphy sells for a large sum, and there are so many requests that you can't possibly fulfil them all yourself. Why not employ a ghostwriter? That way all you have to do is sign your name."

梁同书回答说：“我不能那样做。别人诚心诚意求我写字，我怎么好欺骗人家呢？”

Liang Tongshu replied: "I can't do that. People who ask for my calligraphy come to me in good faith. I couldn't betray them like that."

有一次一个日本商人拿着日本王子的信和书法手迹来求见梁同书，请他对王子的书法进行评定。跟他同来的还有一位日本留学生。

One day a Japanese merchant arrived with a letter written by the crown prince of the Japanese empire. He wanted Liang Tongshu to evaluate the prince's calligraphy. The merchant was accompanied by a Japanese student. 

梁同书本来不想见他们，可客人再三请求才出来相见。那位日本商人拿出了日本王子手迹，请梁同书评定。梁同书看了以后很客气的说了几点看法，就把手迹还给了商人。分手的时候，梁同书问那位日本留学生：“你为什么一定要见我呢？”

Initially, Liang Tongshu was reluctant to meet them, but they made request after request, and in the end, he agreed. The Japanese merchant handed over the crown prince's letter and asked Liang Tongshu for his evaluation of the prince's calligraphy. Liang looked at the letter and politely offered some opinions. He then returned the letter to the merchant. As they were preparing to leave, Liang asked the Japanese student: "Why did you want to see me?"

那位留学生回答说：

The student replied:

> “我到贵国学习的前夕，天皇召见了我，嘱咐我一定要来见一见梁先生。我马上要毕业回国了，如果见不到梁先生，我回去如何向天皇报告呢？”

> "before embarking on the voyage to your great nation to study, I was summoned by the emperor. He commanded that I must go to pay my respects to Mr Liang. I am scheduled to return to my motherland soon. If I didn't come to see you, sir, how could I face the emperor again?"

梁同书听了那位留学生的话很受感动。那个留学生又说：“今天见到了梁先生，愿望实现了。您能不能给我写几个字，我好回去向天皇复命。”

Liang Tongshu was deeply moved by what he heard. The student continued: "Today, I have fulfilled my promise and satisfied my wish. Would you consider writing a few words for me to take back to the emperor? "

梁同书马上提笔给这位青年人写了一张便条作为纪念，并预祝他一路平安。

Liang Tongshu picked up a brush and wrote a note for the student to keep as a souvenir, wishing him a safe journey home.
